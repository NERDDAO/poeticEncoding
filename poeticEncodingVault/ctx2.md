Step-by-step:

1. **Research Question:** Can poetry improve the information density of embedding data?

2. **Kolmogorov Complexity:**
   - Focuses on the shortest possible description of a message.
   - Poetry often distills complex ideas into concise, rich forms which align with Kolmogorov's principles of compression and meaningful reduction.

3. **Shannon's Information Theory:**
   - Traditionally quantifies information in terms of bits and examines efficiency in transmission.
   - Poetry can capture dense information, potentially leading to more efficient encoding and transmission of data.

4. **Autoencoders:**
   - Neural networks that learn efficient data representations.
   - Poetry, through its compressed and evocative nature, can serve as a model for creating low-dimensional embeddings that retain essential features.

5. **Symbolism and Art:**
   - Effective communication through symbols parallels how poetry encodes deep meaning in minimal text.
   - This can inform approaches to embedding data by focusing on preserving fundamental and impactful content.

6. **Knowledge Graphs:**
   - Structures linking concepts in a way that mimetically represents relationships and knowledge.
   - Poetry, by reducing noise and concisely encoding meaning, can help refine knowledge graph representations and improve their information density.

**Conclusion:**
Poetry, by exemplifying dense encoding of meaning, can serve as an inspiration for improving the information density of embedding data. It aligns with principles from Kolmogorov's complexity and Shannon's information theory, offering potential methods for creating compact, meaningful data representations that preserve essential features and relationships.
