Depending on the group, individual voices are told
their message will receive greater amplification if it comes
from another, the danger of speaking openly is so great
they must be protected, their individual voices disrupt the
harmony of consensus, or they are part of a collective and
will be shunned if they dare speak with their own name.
Assemblies ignore those who are too uncomfortable or
unassertive to be heard in crowds and most are very
unconcerned by the lack of input from these people as they
‘had the opportunity’ to speak. Differing levels of comfort
or ability in this activity are rarely acknowledged.
Assemblies and all other group and public activities have
continued the oligarchies of the extroverts.

Most importantly, the free information beliefs of
many groups which threaten power have been twisted to
conflate credit theft with free information. Credit theft has
absolutely nothing to do with free information. Copyright
and patent laws which are structured to ensure fame and
profit for those that can afford the fees and are the quickest
to file forms have created a society and a history filled with
people celebrated for creations they did not originate and
filled also with creative people who died in poverty and
anonymity because they did not have the gift of self
promotion. While intellectual property rights need to be
abolished as they are inhibiting progress and being used as
a tool of inappropriate permanent economic control and
intimidation, idea credit rights need far more recognitionand need to start being applied to the originator, not the
copyright or patent holders.
!
Credit theft is a severe impediment to equality. It is
as common now as ever for a person with access to
powerful forums to pick up an idea from a person unable
to reach the public and use it to enhance their own
reputation. This is frequently brushed off in groups
fighting for societal change as ‘the hive’ owns the idea,
everyone does the role they choose, and it just so happens
that the role most suitable to those in power (western men)
is interviews, public speaking, books, etc., while the silent
and unrecognized work is more ‘suitable’ to the
introverted or those without the power to take the stage.
Any criticism or resentment is met with outrage that the
originator cares more for their own fame than ‘the cause’.
!
Credit for one’s work or ideas is the right of every
person. Credit provides the human dignity of societal
recognition, approval and belonging. Credit for ideas and
actions is an inherent part of personal identity. Unlike
copying, which is not theft, taking credit deprives the
rightful owner of it and is theft. There is no need to ever
hide the origin of information unless the ultimate goal is to
isolate them and suppress or twist their messages or use
their work to glorify another.
!
A person who takes your idea and information to use and
build upon is your collaborator, tester and colleague. A person
who takes your credit or your voice is your enemy, a thief who
steals your societal recognition and approval for themselves and
would be your tyrant.

People grieve more, feel more importance is due to
those they hear of more. Even on social media the deathsof three people in Boston16 caused immediate international
hysteria compared to the delayed response to the deaths of
over a thousand in a factory collapse in Bangladesh17 or
the almost non-existent response to possibly 2 - 300
civilians massacred by the Nigerian military18 all within
weeks of each other. A young western male doing anything
that can be mislabeled as hacking can occupy international
news for any reason or none. When he is also a journalist
the result is the exhaustive and entirely unwarranted
international coverage of the firing of Reuters social media
editor Matthew Keys or the equally irrational coverage of
all things Anonymous and Lulzsec. Any story involving a
girl with a sewing machine or a grandmother in Africa has
no chance at all of being in the news. If it becomes
necessary to cover those continually marginalized groups,
they are presented within the lens of what western men
think of them. The Rohingya genocide19 and ritual
murders in Gabon20 were ignored until Anonymous gave
international media an angle they could use, one profiling
western male hackers.

To allow local governance and solutions, local
voices must be the ones which formulate problems and
create dialogue. People who are currently faceless and
voiceless do not need another to be their face and voice.

While most action based systems can be completely
open to participation by anyone, there are situations where
an elite level of knowledge and accreditation of some sort
is necessary prior to participation. Complicated surgery or
engineering are examples of this type of work. While
accreditation can and should come from the user group
and be completely transparent and permeable, ability in
many cases can only be reviewed by those who have
attained an above average level of specialized knowledge.
In these cases, there must be peer acknowledged levels of
expertise attached to specific people, a situation not
compatible with pure stigmergy or horizontal action.
!
Idea based systems such as some scientific research,
which should be open to all contributions, require
extensive feedback and peer review of ideas, both to
identify signal from noise and to provide knowledge
bridges between elite levels of knowledge and casual
users. In many specialized systems such as the
pharmaceutical industry, the entire user group has an
urgent interest in ensuring that ideas are properly audited
but few have the interest or ability to inform themselves to
the level necessary to be able to audit. No one has the time
to inform themselves to an expert level of knowledge in
every system which affects them, even if that information
is completely transparent and available to all. In these
systems, ideas need to be promoted by those users
qualified to understand them.
