Idea driven systems
!
“Turing believes machines think. Turing lies with men.
Therefore machines cannot think.” – Alan Turing
!
Representative democracies are part of a
personality driven celebrity culture where people are
encouraged to support their chosen personalities or groups
in any action they take. This has changed from recent
history, where celebrity culture existed but was moderated.
People were encouraged to choose principles they
supported and ensure those principles were met by any
action, regardless of the actor. The advantage of a
personality driven system to those in power is it allows
them to disregard the principles agreed to in a social
contract. It also makes favour swapping and influence
peddling the preferred methods of negotiation rather than
simply negotiating each action on its own merits, a
situation apparent in representative governance
assemblies such as the United Nations.
!
When any criticism of an action taken by person A
is met by cries that you must then support person B, we
are dealing with a personality driven system. When similar
actions that make Zimbabwe’s President Mugabe an
alleged war criminal make the United States President
Obama a Nobel Peace Prize winner, we are dealing with a
personality driven system. When no action taken by a
person ‘you support’ must ever be criticized, when we are
encouraged to just trust an authority with no knowledge of
their actions, when we are given the opportunity to vote
for a person instead of actions, we are dealing with a
personality driven system. This allows us no real control
over our governance or the actions taken by our society at
all. In representative democracy, far more of the public’stime is spent debating what ought to be completely
irrelevant personal attributes and studying politicians
instead of policy.
!
A democratic ideal is a system of laws written to
apply equally to all people in all cases. Many states have
been attempting to circumvent those laws by reclassifying
people as ‘terrorists’ or ‘terrorist groups’ and pretending
these groups are not allowed the same rights as others, in
direct contradiction to the underlying principles. ‘Two
wrongs don’t make a right’, once a commonly repeated
cliché, is now almost never heard. It is widely accepted
that wrongs towards some people in some cases are a
‘necessary evil’.
!
The new power of personality driven systems is
being illustrated in wars where all effort is expended
trying to cloud or identify who is behind each group of
fighters, seen horribly in places like Syria and the
Democratic Republic of Congo. The effort to identify
groups is meant to aid allegiances and guide people in
supporting one group of men with guns committing
atrocities or another. An action or idea driven system
would reject all who commit atrocities equally and support
those building society. That is an incredibly simplistic
statement when applied to the two cases above, but the
root evil of investing in men with guns instead of people
building societies is recognized in all areas of the world
which suffer permanent ‘instability’. The solution of just
identifying ‘the good guys’ or deciding ‘there are no good
guys’ was created and is continually promoted by those
selling the weapons.
!
Where once soldiers were regular civilians who left
their everyday lives to fight in defence of their societies,
and were therefore worthy of the highest honour and
gratitude, those civilians are now called ‘terrorists’,
‘militants’ and ‘unprivileged combatants’ and we are
informed they have no right to fight in wars and are in factwar criminals for doing so. The people who deserve
honour we are told, are professional paid killers, willing to
do anything they are told, not in defence of their society
but in offense to any country they are paid to attack. Our
laws have been twisted to grant impunity to those we once
reviled as mercenaries and make war criminals of those we
once celebrated as heroes.
!
The disease of personality driven systems extends
to entire groups, where the same action taken by one is
terrorism, by the other is self defence. Most extreme are
those who feel killing babies is justified if Israel is killing
them, or those that feel the United States 2012 NDAA’s
provision for indefinite detainment of US citizens is
horrifying, the US Patriot Act’s same power over everyone
without US citizenship not worthy of notice. The faults of
personality driven systems have been called by many
names, racism, sexism, ageism, nationalism and more, but
all of those -isms mean the same thing. People are being
judged as nouns instead of verbs.
!
If instead of supporting nouns, we supported ideas and
actions, it would be far easier to follow our chosen principles in
all cases.
!
The groundbreaking social theorists Anonymous
have attempted in the past years to create a hierarchy of
information, an oligarchy of ideas, in an attempt to escape
the pitfalls of personality driven governance. Memes are a
perfect example of concise ideas being shared for the value
of their information with no need of further authority.
Memes can also be used to circumvent censorship. Sina
Weibo users talking about May 35th and other dates to
mean the June 4, 1989 Tiannanmen Square anniversary is
an example of ideas overcoming language control. China
has the fastest moving memes of anywhere in the world
due to the speed of their censors and they have developedingenuous idea and action driven systems to avoid
retribution on personalities. The Sunday stroll of the short
lived Jasmine Revolution15 is one of many examples of
gamified mass protests which everyone can play without
direct instruction from an authority.
!
The promotion of ideas also allows ideas to be
evaluated and fact checked on their own merits rather than
accepted or rejected based on acceptance of the source.
This is the best method of impartial evaluation since bad
data can come from good places and vice versa. It is also
the only way to be heard for voices which are marginalized
otherwise. An idea based culture, where seeming majority
opinions are rejected in favour of facts and individual
assessment, is also the only real defence against
astroturfers and persona management software, used
online to simulate mass support where there is none.
!
Personality based systems have been fought for
several years by citizen journalists who rejected the idea
that only news from official channels was ‘trustworthy’ or
‘safe’ and have largely won that battle. There are still many
battles ahead before people cease to be considered above
reproach or failure and ideas are accepted for
consideration blindly. In many ways, we are moving into
more entrenched personality based systems with online
celebrity influence wielding more power than ever, but it is
also more obviously ridiculous now and we have more
power to revoke celebrity influence if we choose.
!
The first right of any person in an idea driven society
must be the right to communicate. Without communication there
is no way to safeguard our other rights or for us to participate
fully in a society.
15 Marsh, Heather, Street maintenance and a cup of tea with police in China,
WL Central, 24 Feb 2011!
When your right to communicate is interrupted by
those who would be your voice, your face or your
representative, you are being subjected to the governance
of another. Horizontal governance does not mean no one
gets a voice, it means everyone does. A person or group
who attempts to suppress the voices of others is
attempting to seize control. Official group channels are
representative governance, regardless of consensus that
may or may not lie behind them. A person who interprets
another’s voice instead of amplifying it is assuming
control over the originator.
!
People giving a ‘face’ to a cause are standing
between the people affected and the world. Media who
pretend to write stories about groups whose voices are
never heard but write almost universally through the lens
of western men instead, are ensuring that all
interpretations and solutions come from the same small
segment of society. Wars are told from the point of view of
arms dealers and politicians, disasters are interpreted by
NGO’s, most issues are never covered at all. Official
channels decide what will or will not be revealed and
media are rewarded for their obedience by access to more
official information.
!
New media in its current form has made this worse
instead of better. Journalists write about those powerful in
social media to have their stories amplified by the same
people. The news – celebrity symbiosis has escalated as
writers vie for page views which can be granted by their
chosen subject. We are at risk of having increasingly
narrow news coverage as platforms like Twitter move to
increase amplification of already powerful accounts and
hide the less powerful opinions from view. As information
and voice amplification become the new symbols of power,
those who would assume control of society have moved to
hoard voice amplification and control the message
received by the public in new ways.!
The pressure for marginalized groups to stay in
their marginalized roles increases as does their
opportunities to escape. While it was once possible to
simply identify people in relation to a more powerful
figure, as assistant, wife, staff, servant, serf, slave or other,
the internet provided the opportunity for all to have an
equal voice free of relation to others. The backlash to this
freedom has been widespread even, or perhaps especially,
in the groups fighting for social change.
!
Depending on the group, individual voices are told
their message will receive greater amplification if it comes
from another, the danger of speaking openly is so great
they must be protected, their individual voices disrupt the
harmony of consensus, or they are part of a collective and
will be shunned if they dare speak with their own name.
Assemblies ignore those who are too uncomfortable or
unassertive to be heard in crowds and most are very
unconcerned by the lack of input from these people as they
‘had the opportunity’ to speak. Differing levels of comfort
or ability in this activity are rarely acknowledged.
Assemblies and all other group and public activities have
continued the oligarchies of the extroverts.
!
Most importantly, the free information beliefs of
many groups which threaten power have been twisted to
conflate credit theft with free information. Credit theft has
absolutely nothing to do with free information. Copyright
and patent laws which are structured to ensure fame and
profit for those that can afford the fees and are the quickest
to file forms have created a society and a history filled with
people celebrated for creations they did not originate and
filled also with creative people who died in poverty and
anonymity because they did not have the gift of self
promotion. While intellectual property rights need to be
abolished as they are inhibiting progress and being used as
a tool of inappropriate permanent economic control and
intimidation, idea credit rights need far more recognitionand need to start being applied to the originator, not the
copyright or patent holders.
!
Credit theft is a severe impediment to equality. It is
as common now as ever for a person with access to
powerful forums to pick up an idea from a person unable
to reach the public and use it to enhance their own
reputation. This is frequently brushed off in groups
fighting for societal change as ‘the hive’ owns the idea,
everyone does the role they choose, and it just so happens
that the role most suitable to those in power (western men)
is interviews, public speaking, books, etc., while the silent
and unrecognized work is more ‘suitable’ to the
introverted or those without the power to take the stage.
Any criticism or resentment is met with outrage that the
originator cares more for their own fame than ‘the cause’.
!
Credit for one’s work or ideas is the right of every
person. Credit provides the human dignity of societal
recognition, approval and belonging. Credit for ideas and
actions is an inherent part of personal identity. Unlike
copying, which is not theft, taking credit deprives the
rightful owner of it and is theft. There is no need to ever
hide the origin of information unless the ultimate goal is to
isolate them and suppress or twist their messages or use
their work to glorify another.
!
A person who takes your idea and information to use and
build upon is your collaborator, tester and colleague. A person
who takes your credit or your voice is your enemy, a thief who
steals your societal recognition and approval for themselves and
would be your tyrant.
!
People grieve more, feel more importance is due to
those they hear of more. Even on social media the deathsof three people in Boston16 caused immediate international
hysteria compared to the delayed response to the deaths of
over a thousand in a factory collapse in Bangladesh17 or
the almost non-existent response to possibly 2 - 300
civilians massacred by the Nigerian military18 all within
weeks of each other. A young western male doing anything
that can be mislabeled as hacking can occupy international
news for any reason or none. When he is also a journalist
the result is the exhaustive and entirely unwarranted
international coverage of the firing of Reuters social media
editor Matthew Keys or the equally irrational coverage of
all things Anonymous and Lulzsec. Any story involving a
girl with a sewing machine or a grandmother in Africa has
no chance at all of being in the news. If it becomes
necessary to cover those continually marginalized groups,
they are presented within the lens of what western men
think of them. The Rohingya genocide19 and ritual
murders in Gabon20 were ignored until Anonymous gave
international media an angle they could use, one profiling
western male hackers.
!
To allow local governance and solutions, local
voices must be the ones which formulate problems and
create dialogue. People who are currently faceless and
voiceless do not need another to be their face and voice.

where urgent local news can be collected and amplified
globally when necessary, and where the people of the
world decide which news is important, not official news
channels or celebrity nodes.Expertise without oligarchy
!
While most action based systems can be completely
open to participation by anyone, there are situations where
an elite level of knowledge and accreditation of some sort
is necessary prior to participation. Complicated surgery or
engineering are examples of this type of work. While
accreditation can and should come from the user group
and be completely transparent and permeable, ability in
many cases can only be reviewed by those who have
attained an above average level of specialized knowledge.
In these cases, there must be peer acknowledged levels of
expertise attached to specific people, a situation not
compatible with pure stigmergy or horizontal action.
!
Idea based systems such as some scientific research,
which should be open to all contributions, require
extensive feedback and peer review of ideas, both to
identify signal from noise and to provide knowledge
bridges between elite levels of knowledge and casual
users. In many specialized systems such as the
pharmaceutical industry, the entire user group has an
urgent interest in ensuring that ideas are properly audited
but few have the interest or ability to inform themselves to
the level necessary to be able to audit. No one has the time
to inform themselves to an expert level of knowledge in
every system which affects them, even if that information
is completely transparent and available to all. In these
systems, ideas need to be promoted by those users
qualified to understand them.
!
It is necessary to define a form of elitism, of ideas
or people, that will take advantage of expertise but not
remove control of a system from the end users. Ignoring
elite knowledge in favour of a pretense at completely
horizontal governance will not eliminate elitism, it willonly create hidden oligarchies dominated by those without
the expertise required, usually celebrity personalities.
!
In allowing this form of elitism, ultimate choice
must always be left with the entire user group. An
epistemic community is a knowledge resource only.
Superior knowledge can only be forced to work for the
wellbeing of the entire user group if authority remains
with the entire user group and the epistemic community is
forced to remain completely transparent and permeable.
Science may dream of brilliant innovations, but the user
group controls whether those are implemented or created.
This authority also provides the incentive for transparency
and knowledge bridges to explain reasoning to the entire
group.
!
As in stigmergy, votes in a concentric group are
frequently replaced by actions, as expert review will show
the options most likely to bring the best results. This
information is then available to all and those options will,
barring outside factors, be accepted as best practices by
most of the user group. The celebrated hive mind behind
recent actions has never actually existed in practice. The
hive takes actions but ideas originate with individuals. On
every occasion depicted as a mass hive action there has
been epistemic community or solitary planning initiating a
butterfly effect. Even when these planning groups are
theoretically open to all, they are in actuality only open to
those with knowledge of them. Acknowledging epistemic
communities does not create them, it simply brings them
into the open and allows any member of the user group to
participate.
!
An epistemic community can be people or ideas,
depending on the situation. Idea based systems should
promote ideas instead of people, a body of laws instead of
a judiciary. Action in a specialized action based system can
only be taken by those peer recognized as qualified but
meaningful input can come from a broad section of theuser group and be evaluated and promoted by those
qualified. Promoting ideas also allows auditing of an idea
without all the unrelated distraction of attached
personalities. There is an urgent need to separate expertise
from popularity. Influence held by social media celebrities
using strategies such as ‘team followback’ or influence
peddling to earn social media rewards must not replace
real trust networks of expertise recommendation. Nor
must charisma and public relations skills replace
knowledge in physical meetings.
!
In a concentric user group, people or ideas
promoted to the center by their peer group receive greatest
amplification and their findings will be audited, amplified
and explained to the general public by outer circles. Note:
Concentric circles relate to sound amplification – the voices or
ideas in the centre are amplified more greatly. They are not
hierarchical as they have no direct control over the actions of
anyone. While transparency will ensure that conversations
at the centre are heard by all, it is unlikely that they will be
understood by those with no knowledge of the system. It is
not reasonable to expect those in the epistemic community
to explain their reasoning to every member of the user
group and attempt to educate every member to an elite
level of understanding, but those of the user group with an
interest have a right to education and understanding of
that which effects them.
!
Communication should not be the full
responsibility of the experts in the centre, but should be
carried over expertise bridges by full transparency and
user participation. It is the responsibility of each user in an
open system to educate themselves to their own level of
comfort using the data and user population at each level to
inform themselves. Their input and decision making
impact would then be commensurate with the expertise
they acquire. The epistemic community in the centre
should not need to protect themselves from demands orattacks from completely uninformed users. The circles of
expertise which promoted them to the centre should also
verify and explain their findings to the outer circles.
!
Ideas can never be furthered if discussion is always
at the level of the novice and the ideas of an expert can
only be tested by other experts with equal understanding
of the topic. In a concentric user group, the receptive field
is stronger near the centre, so informed opinions will be
heard more clearly by experts in the centre, but full
transparency will allow anyone from any part of the
system to be as informed as they wish to be by any other
part.
!
Knowledge bridges allow discussion to be held at
every level of expertise and corrected by those with greater
knowledge. Knowledge bridges also allow input from
casual users to be instantly promoted to be heard by the
epistemic community if the user group finds the points
valid. Knowledge bridges need to ensure that the best
ideas are promoted and disseminated, regardless of the
attractiveness or popularity of the person with the
expertise.
!
Acceptance of ideas must be controlled by the
entire user group, and the user group must always have
the power to shun, thereby removing power from, any
peer promoted expert. This is necessary to avoid a closed
oligarchy but it must be approached warily so that the
amplified voices in the center are the true experts, not the
most populist and attractive choices. It is incumbent on the
user group to protect the center from celebrity grabbing
manipulation if they are not to recreate the populist
systems of representative democracy.
!
In representative democracy we have learned that
people in general prefer to place their faith in leaders who
are like them instead of leaders who are so expert they do
not understand them. In order to avail ourselves of the
greatest expertise on each topic, we must place our mostknowledgeable experts in a position of transparent
authority while also providing a knowledge bridge leading
from their ideas to the casually interested observer.
According to Leta Hollingworth’s research, to be a leader
of their contemporaries a child must be more intelligent
but not too much more intelligent than them. A
discrepancy of more than about 30 points of IQ does not
allow for leadership, or even respect or effective
communication. The same principle appears to hold for
levels of knowledge on a given topic.
!
Hollingworth notes: A lesson which many gifted
persons never learn as long as they live is that human beings in
general are inherently very different from themselves in thought,
in action, in general intention, and in interests. Many a reformer
has died at the hands of a mob which he was trying to improve in
the belief that other human beings can and should enjoy what he
enjoys. This is one of the most painful and difficult lessons that
each gifted child must learn, if personal development is to
proceed successfully. It is more necessary that this be learned
than that any school subject be mastered. Failure to learn how to
tolerate in a reasonable fashion the foolishness of others leads to
bitterness, disillusionment, and misanthropy (Hollingworth,
1942, p. 259)21.
!
This loss of expertise is a tragedy for both the
experts and society. There needs to be a method of
organization that will use all expertise at the level it will be
most effective and avoid communication barriers. Those
with elite knowledge need to be able to have relatively
quiet conversations with others that can expand and audit
the knowledge base while still providing complete
transparency, permeability and control for the rest of the
user group.
21 Hollingworth, L. S., Children above 180 IQ (Stanford-Binet): Origin and
development, Yonkers-on-Hudson, NY: World Book Company, 1942!
Most manifestations of attempts at horizontal
governance attempt to deny all elitism by discouraging or
forbidding it in any form and denying its necessity.
Whether or not oligarchy exists, elitism most certainly
does, in every field that requires expertise beyond that of a
novice. To not allow elitism would be to not allow
expertise, which would cripple any society. Elite levels of
knowledge exist today for many reasons, exclusion of the
majority of the population from education and access
being the biggest. As an ideal in an open transparent
society, anyone would be capable of attempting to
contribute to elite knowledge resources, but limitations of
interest or ability will still exclude all but a few. This is not
an evil if it is properly controlled and it is in fact the best
way to ensure decisions based on real expertise instead of
connections and other sources of power.
!
Where elite knowledge exists, there will always be
elite conversations. If there are not clubs which require
membership then there are parties such as that which
started Martha Stewart’s troubles, or just conversations
that are held above the level of a novice’s understanding.
The keys to allowing elite expertise but not allowing for
elite conspiracies are transparency and knowledge bridges.
If Martha had instantly tweeted the conversation at her
elite party and people had rapidly spread its meaning to a
novice level, there would have been no unfair advantage
in her conversation.
!
Oligarchies appear to be inevitable for many
reasons. The reasons related to control of the work of
others for achieving goals we can overcome by using
stigmergy, consensus and other tools, but there is a place in
society for an elite system of knowledge, and that
knowledge will always be a source of power. The key to
preventing elite knowledge from becoming a tyrannical
oligarchy is to maintain control by the user group over
action and decisions and treat epistemic communitiesalways as a knowledge resource, not a governing power.
Shunning can be used to instantly remove power in an
open system, keeping the real power within the user
group, not the epistemic community. No system of elite
knowledge must ever become unassailable. When
combined with stigmergy, the work produced in systems
with transparent, permeable epistemic communities may
finally be of the highest standard we can attain and the
work environments will allow autonomous control for all.
!
Once there were exclusive clubs and organizations
where people could go to isolate themselves and rule the
world in elite company. They need to be replaced with
transparent, helpful epistemic communities which are part
of the community. The Communist Party of China, the
Vatican and the Davos group are all examples of
oligarchies which no longer have any legitimate reason to
conduct their activities in secrecy and with no input from
their user groups.
!
If power from property ownership and hierarchical
organizations are removed, knowledge and celebrity will be the
dominant sources of power and the places to watch for a new
oligarchy.
Shunning, trolling and photoshopping
!
In concentric circles, experts are peer promoted
based on reputation instead of certification by an external
authority. Each user of a system can review the work of the
active members both directly and through the expert
review of the active member’s peers instead of placing
their faith in a third party certification. Additionally,
experts can be created by the system itself as users develop
knowledge, expertise and reputation and move towards
the centre. Third party authorities such as universities areno longer necessary. It is essential that peer review of
expertise is done fairly and without personality based bias.
!
In an inclusive society, shunning is the most
effective punishment for violation of the social contract.
Shunning removes the offending person from all of the
benefits of belonging to a society. As the prison systems
can attest, particularly those that practice the torture of
solitary confinement, the effects of shunning are terrible to
humans, an inherently highly social species.
!
In an otherwise non-coercive society, shunning is
also the most effective way of removing power from a
member of an epistemic community. Ideas which no one
follows will wither and die, they only become powerful
with the agreement of the actors. Conversations which
engage no one will fall silent. Shunning is a very powerful
tool and should be recognized as such, and not used
lightly or maliciously to block access to power.
!
In a permeable system open to input by all, trolling
is used to assess expertise where it is not immediately
apparent and allow or block participation in conversations
of elite knowledge. The jargon employed in most
specialized fields is used to facilitate this trolling, as well as
inside jokes, conversations that allow quick assessment of
knowledge levels and traps to make the less
knowledgeable participant appear foolish. Trolling
frequently becomes ad hominem attack to drive a
participant from a conversation if they have been found to
not have the appropriate level of knowledge. While the
first form is an expedient way to keep conversations at an
elite level and allow input only from those qualified, as
well as to exclude sock puppets and astroturfing online,
trolling is a form of shunning and should never be used to
drive away people who are qualified or those who are
honestly trying to learn.
!
Actions which would be celebrated from western
men become discredited and downplayed if it is foundthey originated from a marginalized group. In We Are
Anonymous22 , a work celebrating western male ‘hackers’,
the resentment of the female author at the necessary
inclusion of a few women in the story is palpable. Of
Laurelai we are told “she was also spending about twelve
hours a day online while her mother looked after her two kids.”
Of Jennifer Emick, who correctly discovered the real life
identity of Lulzsec member Sabu, she “often got the kids to
cook dinner. They ate a lot of pizza.” Emick was married, with
teenagers. Not once is the reader told what the two far
younger little girls in Sabu’s sole custody were eating
while he was online. Every woman who accomplishes
anything newsworthy has her personal life examined for
neglect of other aspects so it can be a story of failure
instead of one of success. “Rumor had it that No had gained
her status by flirting with other male operators.” The male
operators who gained their status by either flirting with or
befriending other men do not have their accomplishment
discredited.
!
Frequently, trolling and shunning are used to keep
some from positions of power. Sexual and other
harassment to prevent people from speaking, meetings in
places or conducted in a manner to make them
uncomfortable for some, or harsher standards and far
more trolling of those who are automatically assumed to
be inferior are examples of oligarchies defending their turf.
Current epistemic communities are the new private clubs.
The same standards of admittance should be applied to all.
Internet anonymity for many was akin to emerging from
Plato’s cave with the ability for the first time to join all
conversations and be treated as an equal as long as the
anonymity was unbroken. That ability needs to be
22 Olson, Parmy, We Are Anonymous: Inside the Hacker World of LulzSec,
Anonymous, and the Global Cyber Insurgency, Little, Brown and Company,
5 Jun 2012defended for all, even in a system where people are
known.
!
Photoshopping is another way of ensuring that
credit is given to only a few. Almost all actions and bodies
of knowledge involve several people. It is simple to
exclude some as being peripheral and highlight others as
central without much notice being taken. Rosalind
Franklin’s work could be called peripheral to Watson and
Crick’s, perhaps not as important, and the choice of the
two over the one downplayed. But when you begin to see
everyone but western men drastically underrepresented in
every list of important people, it raises the possibility that
perhaps everyone else is being photoshopped out of the
stories with inferior titles, inferior media attention and
inferior idea crediting.
!
Women historically come with built in anonymity,
everything they say has been proxy routed through the
nearest man and given no credence until it was. The work
of introverts is claimed by extroverts, the work of voices
discredited is claimed by accepted personalities. Blogs
reference each other as the corporate media refuses to
name them. Western men own media empires which hire
western men which interview western men. The
misogynist labeled reddit 23 24 25 ensures those articles
featuring men are widely read. Wikipedia’s over 95% male

editing, as well as being an amplification and glorification
of western male dominated corporate media. Wikipedia’s
reliance on corporate sources ensures corporate control
over knowledge. They produce a reference populated
largely with western men in positions of influence which is
used to determine online measures of influence. Klout
scores and other influence ranking sites fall victim to the
Hawthorne Effect and instead of documenting influence
they create it. All of this data is used to determine who sits
on panels and boards, who is given awards, who is hired
for positions of influence and the image we all carry in our
heads of what an expert looks like.
!
Women especially, are defined in relation to men, as
assistant, secretary, aide, etc. In this way, they can perform
the same or more work, but credit for their work and ideas
is preemptively assigned to the person they are defined in
relation to and they are locked out of receiving influence.
Non western voices are put into sub-categories, they are
not ‘thought leaders’, they are ‘African thought leaders’.
Like ‘women’s issues’ these sub-categories become ghettos
where no one ever looks except for tokenism. Those
refused recognition leave in frustration, as they must
produce many times the content to receive any recognition
and must not complain or they will be further
marginalized. Young students are left with no mentors in a
system where those similar to them are erased.

List”, The New York Times, 30 Jan, 201127
!
The exclusion is so pervasive the US media even
overwhelmingly go to men for opinions on ‘women’s
issues’ as seen in the preceding chart. For general issues
such as politics, the conversation has revolved around men
with guns and money for so long, with the rare article on
victimized women, it is as if no one even realizes there are
alternative stories, such as all the people building society
instead of destroying it. The token women in media are not
taken seriously as mainstream news sources unless they
only report on men and interview men. Without these
alternative stories, people are left with the choice of
supporting one group of men with guns and money or
another, choosing one as ‘good guys’ and the other as ‘bad
guys’, despite the similarity of actions. The story of
creators is considered not as newsworthy as the story of
destroyers, killing people is both newsworthy and a
27 “Female Voices in Media Infographic”, 4th Estate, 2012respected career while giving birth is neither. These limited
views dictate the structure of our society.
!
In many or most cases, this exclusion is not
deliberate, those doing the excluding are not even aware
they are doing it. When you are standing in the spotlight
you can’t see the shadows. Many times it seems those in
the spotlight are unaware of the existence of others on the
stage. It is essential to maintain transparent, idea and
action driven systems with vigilant user groups to keep
epistemic communities inclusive and open.
Epistemic communities in action based systems
!
In open source software, the code for each project is
available for all to see. Even if the end user cannot
understand the code, they can go to discussion groups and
read or listen to programmers who have read and audited
the code, hear their discussions, and watch them find bugs
and discuss alternative solutions. The people with the
greater knowledge of the system will provide knowledge
bridges for people at a more novice level. Good ideas from
these discussions can be read, discussed and possibly
implemented by the developers as well. Open source
software with forums open to all are a perfect working
example of fully transparent and audited systems of elite
knowledge. While the decisions are made by the
developers, review and acceptance or rejection of the
software is the right of the user group. If the developers
refuse to listen to the user group and another development
team is willing to work on the project, the original code
can be forked and modified to meet the user requirements.
!
Traditional systems primarily use a supposedly
representative sample of the user group to provide
periodic feedback. This feedback is delivered as
percentages of the population which ignores theimportance of the individual. From an individual
perspective, the chance of dying of a side effect from a
pharmaceutical is either 0% or 100%, group statistics have
no effect on individual experience. Transparent user
groups allow feedback and ideas from the entire user
group, an automatic testing and validation system in place
continually throughout development and operation. Risks
which are ‘statistically insignificant’ become extremely
important when they happen to an active participant in the
user group community. This more accurately reflects a real
society vs a system of dissociation.
!
The github model of open software with
replaceable lords of a fiefdom may be improved on in a
system where the entire epistemic community operates by
consensus, but as long as there is transparency and the
ability for anyone to fork the code and start anew,
oligarchies can still be avoided. Online courses such as
those offered by Coursera where students teach each other
and have direction from an epistemic community of
instructors with knowledge bridges of graduates and
fellow students is another example of a concentric circle in
the cases where the course material is released as creative
commons. CryptoParties are another.
Celebrity and thought leaders
!
As we ponder how to create action and idea based
systems, the internet, and so the world, is becoming more
personality based than ever before in history. The internet
is rapidly transforming from being page centric to people
centric. The hive mind has become me the people. As
liquid democracy type representation becomes more
accepted, personal branding for power becomes even more
entrenched. Anonymity and group work are being pushed
aside in favour of personal celebrity for all.!
Along with celebrity have come tools to measure
celebrity. The first such tool was Wikipedia, a glorification
and amplification of corporate media and English speakers
with technical skills. Now Klout and similar are taking
influence measurement further and not just creating
celebrity oligarchies but also dictating the terms of
engagement between the oligarchies and the user group
with their algorithms. These tools do not just measure
influence, they create it, and unchecked, their algorithms
will dictate the terms of our new society. If Klout scores
people higher for engagement, celebrity thought leaders
will engage. If Klout scores higher for engaging with
higher ranked celebrities, the powerful will become more
powerful and even unassailable. If Klout celebrities score
higher for only interacting with and following each other,
we will have a closed oligarchy.
!
Klout is one example, but there are many powerful
online tools doing the same. The Google search
controversy over whether Google should show people
what they already like instead of presenting a more
realistic, broader view is another. Even a search engine
presenting the most commonly sought result instead of a
random selection helps entrench already entrenched ideas.
Sponsored ‘who to follow’ groups or Twitter’s event pages
with only certain tweeters shown ensure more power for
the powerful. A short time ago, if you wished for real
influence, as opposed to influence created to sell to
marketers, cheating by gaming the influence measurement
systems wouldn’t help, because the tricks brought no real
influence. Now real influence follows the appearance of
influence. In addition to gaming scams it is openly possible
to buy influence, for instance by paying Facebook to
promote your page or Twitter to promote a tweet.
!
While Twitter was a data driven breakthrough for
online society, where no one needed acceptance to begin
interacting, this is becoming less true all the time. Anyonecan speak, but voices are amplified as favours given and
received and the rules change as accounts grow more
powerful. Pure data driven systems are unfortunately
nearly impossible in a world of spam and astroturfing
software. With the vast amounts of data in our world,
celebrity amplification of good ideas is needed. The first
reaction to this realization by those wishing for a
horizontal community was to create group hubs, but these
have largely and correctly been felled by the problems
with group affiliation.
!
An idea popularized by celebrity personality
endorsement
without
knowledgeable
input
can
subsequently be exposed as simplistic, factually incorrect
or otherwise flawed by those with deeper knowledge, but
the celebrity endorsement can drown the expert
knowledge. The Kony 2012 campaign is an example of
celebrity endorsement drowning local knowledge. The
influence of celebrities from entertainment and sports
industries over unrelated topics is illogical but widespread
and they are more than ever expected to use that influence
in areas completely outside their knowledge sphere. When
actors Yao Chen and Chen Kui Kun posted support against
censorship to Southern Weekend newspaper on Sina
Weibo, it appeared more newsworthy than a statement
from the United Nations would be.
!
Even within the entertainment industry, which may
be thought to be within the sphere of celebrity expertise,
most had hoped for grass roots driven promotion to
replace corporate promotion. Instead we find corporate
sponsorship replaced by a tweet from Justin Bieber, which
launched stars such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Psy far more
immediately and effectively than a label ever dreamed of
doing.
!
All of the above sounds very discouraging, but it
really isn’t. The first step in any cleaning and organizing is
to drag everything out to the open to be sorted and that iswhat has happened with celebrity. None of this influence is
new, it is in fact a far more toned down, accessible and
transparent version of the celebrity and influence peddling
we have had for years. It is palatable for an individual you
choose whether or not to follow to recommend an artist
that you can choose to watch or not without diluting your
supply of alternative choices. Compared to the control
once exerted by music labels this does not seem evil. Citing
papers in academia or votes in Hollywood’s Academy
Awards are no less subject to influence peddling.
!
Much of the undue influence is inherently repulsive
to most people, and they have already begun to combat it.
The Kony 2012 campaign suffered an immediate if largely
unheard backlash28 from the people actually in the region.
Today those rebuttals would be even more immediate and
well amplified. Even the traditional pundits from old
corporate media hardly dare write any more about regions
they are not resident of. Soon all such foreign punditry will
be replaced by local voices and news will be reported by
those it is happening to as audiences will demand that
level of informed opinion.
!
A cultural shift is required around celebrity.
Celebrity was created to distract attention from issues the
true oligarchies did not want scrutinized. The public’s
‘right to know’ was transferred from the business of the
government to the plastic surgery of an entertainer. This
type of celebrity is no longer needed and it is becoming
rapidly diluted as the general population Occupy celebrity
by being Tumblr famous, Twitter famous, etc. Expertise is
already largely separate from celebrity. Voice amplification
will soon be merely a job and a fairly boring one at that.
!
Until this cultural shift is complete, it is dangerous
to concentrate even knowledge based celebrity in one
individual or group of individuals, and there must be
28 “Uganda Speaks responds to Kony 2012”, Al Jazeera, 21 Apr 2012continuous intelligent auditing by the user groups. Open
epistemic communities generally are plagued with
members who may or may not be qualified to be there but
they play the outer circles against the inner and create a
human interest story of themselves. Their fame and
popular support makes them impossible to challenge or
shun. This is distracting and detracts from the work of the
community. User groups must ensure that while they
watch their communities for inclusiveness, they do not
allow themselves to be manipulated this way.
!
The tools to moderate a celebrity or expertise
oligarchy are now in the hands of the people. Hopefully
the user groups will moderate, exercise their ability to
shun for bad behaviour and refuse to allow control to leave
the entire user group. There is no reason why a person
with a learning disability should be less happy or satisfied
than one with a brilliant mind, or why gardening should
not be as rewarding a life work choice as participating in
an epistemic community or acquiring internet celebrity. It
is an artificially controlled environment of privilege that
makes one seem better than the other. This is easily
overcome in a population not controlled by their financial
system.Stigmergy
!
Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination
between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in
the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a
next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way,
subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other,
leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently
systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It
produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without
need for any planning, control, or even direct communication
between the agents. – Wikipedia
!
Certain ideas are powerful enough to create a
butterfly effect, a swarm that will not be stopped by any
restraining force. The civil rights movement in the United
States was one such idea which no amount of opposition
could prevent. The power of stigmergy was proven in that
and many other points in history. Stigmergy is the action
based twin of an idea based system. If there are no official
authorities, anyone can act to further an idea and it is up to
the society or user group to accept or reject the act.
!
A personality based system can never allow for
mass collaboration on a global scale without representation
such as that seen in organizations like the United Nations.
If the world is to move away from representation and
allow all voices to be heard, we need to find methods of
collaboration which work with idea and action based
systems. Concentric user groups with epistemic
communities and knowledge bridges may work for idea
based systems. For action, stigmergy seems the best
option.
!
Currently, the typical response to a situation which
requires an action is to create a noun, in the form of acommittee, commission, organization, corporation, NGO,
government body, etc. Far too often, the action never
appears at all as the focus is always on the organization
and the personalities involved instead.
!
Most systems are now run by competitive
organizations. Competition creates redundancy, is slow
and wastes resources on idea protection, advertisement,
and more. Competition also requires secrecy which blocks
progress and auditing and causes lost opportunities and
ideas. Patents and copyrights further limit speed and the
potential for mass input of ideas. Collaboration between
the people with the greatest expertise does not happen
unless they are hired by the same project.
!
The alternative to competition has traditionally
been cooperation. This is most effective only in groups of
two to eight people. For groups larger than 25, cooperation
is agonizingly slow, an exercise in personality management
which quickly degenerates into endless discussion and
soothing of ruffled feathers, is extremely vulnerable to
agent provocateurs, and in large scale groups very seldom
accomplishes anything of value. Cooperation traditionally
operates on the democratic principle that all voices are
equal, so it does not allow for leaders, or users with greater
expertise, energy or understanding to have greater
influence than those on the periphery. Cooperation wastes
a great deal of time and resources in both discussing and
discussing the discussions. In an action based system, this
discussion is rarely required as the opinion of those not
doing the work is probably of little value unless it is
solicited advice from a trusted knowledgeable party.
!
Cooperation and consensus based systems are
usually dominated by extroverted personalities who make
decisions to control the work of others and are justly
resented by those doing the actual work. Most workers do
not enjoy the hierarchical systems shown in the chart
below, as they lose autonomy, mastery and creative controlover their own work. The feeling at the bottom is no
different whether there is a horizontal or a hierarchical
structure making the decisions. Cooperative systems
frequently use consensus or votes to make decisions for the
entire group. These methods may not produce the best
results as many people may not understand the work if
they are not actually doing it, and they may demand
things they would never be willing to do themselves.
Consensus based systems are also prone to the ‘hive mind’
appropriation of credit for individual ideas and labour
which causes further resentment.
Hierarchical systemConsensus hierarchy
!
In the Stigmergy picture below, all workers have
full autonomy to create as they wish. The power of the
user group is in the ability to accept or reject the work.
Since there is no officially designated person to perform a
task, the users are free to create alternatives if they do not
like what they are offered. Workers are free to create
regardless of acceptance or rejection. In the picture below,
some work may be accepted by the largest group, some
alternatives for a different user group, some only by a
small group, and sometimes the worker will be alone with
their vision. In all cases the worker is still free to create as
they wish. History has shown no drastically innovative
ideas that received instant mainstream acceptance and
history also shows that radically new ideas are most often
the result of solitary vision. To leave control of work to
group consensus only is to cripple innovation.Stigmergy
!
In a competitive environment, a new idea is
jealously guarded, legally protected and shrouded in
secrecy. Great effort is expended in finding supporters for
the idea while also ensuring that it remains covered by
legal protections such as non-disclosure agreements. The
idea remains inextricably bound to the creator until it is
legally transferred to another owner. All contributors work
for the owner, not the idea. Contributors must then be
rewarded by the owner which further limits the potential
for development and wastes more resources in legal
agreements, lawsuits, etc. Contributors have no interest in
whether the project succeeds or fails and no motivation to
contribute more than they are rewarded for.
!
If the idea is instead developed cooperatively, it
must first be pitched by the originator, who will attempt to
persuade a group to adopt the idea. The group must be in
agreement with the idea itself and with every stage of its
development. The majority of energy and resources are
spent on communication, persuasion, and personality
management, and the working environment is fraughtwith arguments and power struggles. Because the project
is driven by a group, albeit a cooperative one, the group is
still competitive with other similar outside projects, and
still wastes resources and energy on secrecy, competitive
evangelizing, etc. Both competitive and cooperative
projects will die if the group that runs the project leaves
and both will attract or repel contributors based on the
personalities of the existing group. Both are hierarchical
systems where individuals need to seek permission to
contribute. Both focus on the authority of personalities to
approve a decision instead of focusing on the idea or
action itself.
!
Stigmergy is neither competitive nor traditionally
collaborative.
!
With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and
the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or
group of personalities. No individual needs permission
(competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an
idea or initiate a project. There is no need to discuss or vote
on the idea. If an idea is exciting or necessary it will attract
interest. The interest attracted will be from people actively
involved in the system and willing to put effort into
carrying the project further, not empty votes from people
with little interest or involvement. Since the project is
supported or rejected based on contributed effort, not
empty votes, input from people with more commitment to
the idea will have greater weight. Stigmergy also puts
individuals in control over their own work. They do not
need group permission to tell them what system to work
on or what part to contribute.
!
The person with the initial idea may or may not
carry the task further. Evangelizing the idea is voluntary,
by a group that is excited by the idea. They may or may
not be the ones to carry it out. It is unnecessary to seek
start up funding and supporters. If an idea is good it will
receive the support required. (In practice, that is not trueyet, as few people have the free time to put into volunteer
projects because most are tied to compulsory work under
the existing financial system. Additionally, we still live in a
personality driven system where only powerful
personalities are heard.) Secrecy and competition are
unnecessary because once an idea is given, it and all new
development belongs to anyone who chooses to work on
it. Anyone can submit work for approval, the idea cannot
die or be put on hold by personalities. Acceptance or
rejection is for the work contributed, not the person
contributing it. All ideas are accepted or rejected based on
the needs of the system.
!
Responsibility and rights for the system rest with
the entire user group, not just the creators. There is no
need for people to leave the system based on personality
conflicts as there is no need for communication outside of
task completion and there are usually plenty of jobs with
complete autonomy. As no one owns the system, there is
no need for a competing group to be started to change
ownership.
!
Stigmergy provides little scope for agent
provocateurs as only the needs of the system are
considered. Anyone working against the system’s
functionality is much easier to see and prevent than
someone blocking progress with endless discussion and
creation of personality conflicts. Because the system is
owned by all, there is also no one leader to target.
!
Movements driven by stigmergy usually fluctuate
between periods of stagnation where most are willing to
tolerate the current state and upheavals where a weakness
once named becomes unbearable by all and is changed by
another mass movement. The civil rights movement in the
United States was itself a continuation of the anti-slavery
movement. Once the feeling of injustice past the point of
tolerance spread, stigmergy ensured the idea would not be
suppressed. While neither the upheaval to abolish slaverynor the upheaval for the civil rights movement have
succeeded in providing racial equality in the US, both
made radical progress and the idea will continue until
equality is achieved.
Nodes
!
As work progresses and core team and members
grow, more interested and dedicated personalities emerge
which begin to steer direction. Specialties are formed
around the core team’s interests as the core team produces
the most work and the work most valued by the rest of the
user group. Systems beyond a certain level of complexity
begin to lack coherence as the group’s energy and focus
moves from broad to narrow, following the interests of the
core team and the availability of resources. Parts of the
original system may be left undone.
!
As more members are added, more will experience
frustration at limited usefulness or autonomy. Some of
these members will have an interest in the work left
undone and they will create a new node of like minded
members and new people to take care of the undone work.
Alternatively, casual users and observers of the system,
who lack the desire or expertise to be a more active part of
the original system, will see a different need created and
start a new node. Rather than the traditional corporate
model of endless acquisition and expansion, stigmergy
encourages splintering into different nodes. Because each
individual is responsible only for their own work, and no
one can direct a group of workers, expansion means more
work for the individual, a self limiting prospect. As a
system grows, the additional work requires either
additional resources or splintering. As communication is
easier and there is more autonomy in smaller groups,
splintering is the more likely outcome of growth.!
Communication between nodes of a system is on
an as needed basis. Transparency allows information to
travel freely between the various nodes but a formal
relationship or communication method is neither
necessary nor desirable. Information sharing is driven by
the information, not personal relationships. If data is
relevant to several nodes it will be immediately
transmitted to all, no formal meetings between official
personalities are necessary.
!
Any node can disappear without affecting the
network, and the remaining necessary functionality of that
node can be taken up by others. Nodes which find they are
performing the same tasks will likely join, or one will be
rendered obsolete by lack of use. New nodes are only
created to fulfill a new need or provide greater
functionality. It is inefficient to have the same task
performed twice, and that only occurs if a second group
discovers an alternative method that the first group is
unwilling to adopt. In that case, the best system will win
the most support from the user group, the other will die or
remain as a valued alternative. Any user can contribute to
the node which best matches their interests and abilities, or
contribute to multiple nodes.
!
A new system of governance or collaboration that
does not follow a competitive hierarchical model will need
to employ stigmergy in most of its action based systems. It
is neither reasonable nor desirable for individual thought
and action to be subjugated to group consensus in matters
which do not affect the group and it is frankly impossible
to accomplish complex tasks if every decision must be
presented for approval. That is the biggest weakness of the
hierarchical model. The incredible success of so many
internet projects are the result of stigmergy, not
cooperation, and it is stigmergy that will help us build
quickly, efficiently and produce results far better than any
of us can foresee at the outset.88A world without a
financial system
!
An overriding concern of many people
participating in protests in recent years has been the
financial system. From the September 17, 2011 protests
against financial institutions and the symbolism of Occupy
Wall Street to the widespread discussion of alternative
currencies, money received more air time than even
human rights and war. The current human rights atrocities
and endless wars did not even cause the Arab Spring. It
was the unfairness of the economic systems (starting with
the fining of a fruit seller in Tunisia) which was the initial
driving force behind the 2011 protests. The current
speculation regarding the possible collapse of the financial
system focuses on possible replacements.
!
With all of this attention, it would be easy to
assume that financial systems must be a very important
part of any future economy. But must they? Before we
discuss alternative systems or how to repair our current
system, we need to look at why we need a financial system
at all. If we define the function of our financial systems,
form should follow easily, be it community currency,
barter, p2p digital, resource based or other.
Dissociation
!
The current financial system functions as a means
to tie the work that is done for corporations to basic
essentials such as food and housing in an entirely artificial
relationship. Despite an abundance of basic essentials,
individuals or entire countries can be deprived of them
based on the labour or rights they are providing to
corporations. A system where banks, governments, andmany other valueless institutions also stand between
individuals and basic needs and demand payment
completes the creation of true wage slavery where no
worker can survive outside the system. By providing a
complete disconnect between work required to produce
basic essentials and ownership or access to them, this
system also assures gross overabundance of resources for
people who do no work of value at all. The financial
system enables very inequitable distribution of resources.
!
Wages are commonly described as a motivator to
work. We are told that no one would work if they were not
paid. This is belied by the amount of people raising their
children, cleaning their homes, tending their gardens,
volunteering for fire departments and and writing open
source software and it is belied by cultures in myriad times
and places which survived happily without a financial
system. Women in all cultures are expected to do very
difficult, time consuming, laborious and high risk unpaid
work to give birth and raise children, and in many cultures
they remain as an almost entirely unpaid foundation of
slave labour that the rest of the economy is built upon.
What is referred to as women’s right to work is really the
right to do paid corporate work. All of the work that
benefits society is, has been or could easily be unpaid,
while pay is only required for work that is harmful to
society. Valuation of work rests with corporations and
governments which ensure that workers will engage in
pointlessly dangerous and immoral work that they would
never do otherwise. People are paid to kill people. People
are not paid to give birth. Is it now more socially
acceptable to kill people than to give birth to people? Or is
it just more immediately valuable to corporations? Wages
were created not to motivate us to work, but to control our
work.
!
The jobs that corporations and governments have
chosen to value are almost entirely busywork, pointlessjobs that would not exist in another system, jobs including
but not limited to everything in sales, finance,
management, politics, and more. The end result of
corporate work is far too much product and products and
services that are detrimental to society and the
environment. Any attempts to stop corporate work are met
with the cry that to do so would cause job loss, which is
promoted as a great evil as under this system jobs equal
basic essentials. Jobs are always touted as being in short
supply, valuable, and difficult to obtain, especially the
‘good’ jobs that pay the most money. Jobs are, of course,
not remotely scarce, any child can find hundreds of
valuable things to do at any time, but these valuable jobs
have not had an artificial monetary value associated with
them.
!
Any for profit system is not going to have social or
environmental goals as its mandate (even if it says it does)
and a wage paying system is a for profit system. If profit
were removed, all decisions would be made for social
goals, prison systems would be trying to rehabilitate
prisoners or study to find why they were in violation of the
law instead of just warehousing as many as possible,
medical research would be trying to improve health
instead of selling pharmaceuticals, and agriculture would
be devoted to producing the most nutritious food in the
most environmentally responsible way. Removing profit
would also remove a great deal of the reason for
competitiveness, secrecy and spying within organizations,
along with a great deal of the redundancy of competing
companies providing identical goods and services.
Removing wages attached to a specific system would give
every individual the freedom to leave any system they did
not agree with or that began to malfunction due to core
team problems, a better alternative system or other.
Removing profit eradicates the need for ownership of
knowledge and many other assets.!
On an international level, the financial system
serves to artificially control which countries are wealthy
and which are not. Many of the most resource rich
countries in the world have destitute populations and the
multinational corporations that own the ‘rights’ to their
resources remove the wealth to other countries. At a
national level, the financial system allows banks, who have
no need of housing, to hoard millions of houses while the
children that used to live in them sleep in the streets. At an
individual level, the equating of life’s essentials with the
financial system can control life or death, fulfillment or
wasted potential, contentment or misery.
All of society’s problems which could be solved by money were
caused by money.
Social impact
!
Paid work creates poverty. Anyone not enabling the
corporations and doing their work lives in fear of the legal
and societal persecution that comes with poverty. Poverty
is the hardest work of any available today. It is a very
expensive lifestyle, entailing endless fines, charges and
fees levied by the corporate and government world. It
leaves no time to achieve any fulfillment, is a life
threatening health risk, and is extremely damaging to all
personal relationships. It is naturally almost universally
dreaded.
!
Poverty is also regarded as a moral failure, as
society needs to blame the victim to avoid blaming
themselves for the situation the poor find themselves in. In
this way, courage, duty, industry, thrift, kindness, loyalty –
all of the traditional virtues may be replaced simply by
wealth, the ultimate virtue respected in society today. The
very word ‘unemployed’ states idleness, although anyonewho has been poor knows how much work is involved.
Wealth is used synonymously with success and
achievement. Paid work artificially values one job above
another (and subsequently the person doing that job above
the other) regardless of individual preference. While
manual work might be considered more enjoyable than
executive work by most people, since it provides exercise,
social interaction and purpose, the assigned values teach
us to value pointless executive work instead.
!
Paid work occupies all of our time, and when we
are outside the financial system poverty is a full time job.
This acts to cripple all volunteer work such as community
gardens and open source projects that would otherwise be
done for free and may undermine the system of wage
control over individuals. For those that volunteer anyway,
the financial system ensures that their work, such as child
rearing or innovative thought, is kept from ever resulting
in any kind of independence and encourages those
volunteers to collaborate with the corporate system to
obtain security. Volunteer work is also subject to the same
moral scrutiny as poverty, especially in recent years when
a requirement of being poor is frequently the oxymoronic
compulsory volunteer work associated with receiving
basic essentials. Previously the domain of the rich and idle,
therefore commendable, volunteer work has now become
tainted with the stench of poverty, further limiting willing
participants.
!
Paid work feeds a consumer economy, both by
providing the means to purchase and creating the demand
and need for products. If people had time to play, exercise
and eat healthy food, they would need less medical care. If
they had time to care for each other, they would not need
institutions and NGO’s for care. If they had time to help
themselves and each other they would not require a vast
array of sold products and services. They could alsoparticipate in a far wider variety of activities if they were
not funneled into filling one role only.
!
The current financial system is necessary to control our
work, to control our time, to create poverty, to create division
and to force people to do work which is harmful to society.
A modified system
!
It is possible, and frequently proposed, that the
current financial system be modified to make it accessible
for all to earn the basic essentials of life more easily. This
could be done by having far more types of work valued,
by providing various forms of charity, by forcing
corporations to follow certain workplace standards and
many other tweaks and regulations. All are in the end just
modifications to the master slave relationship and none
recognize the underlying flaws in the system. Who would
be the authority valuing the work, administering the
charity and enforcing the standards? Who has control of
the wages? Whoever maintains authority over the work of
others maintains the hierarchical system and prevents
workers from having autonomy, mastery and control over
their own work. This infantilization of workers, even in a
system with worker’s rights, limits innovation, decreases
satisfaction, and prevents workers from reaching their full
potential.
!
If there is any financial system, there will be
coercion outside the benefit of society. If there is demand
for a house and someone is paid to build a house, that
person will be elevated above someone helping the
mentally ill or gardening. Building houses will then be
seen as a more attractive choice of work regardless of
personal affinity or the needs of society. Where people are
paid to build houses, houses will be destroyed instead ofpreserved, people will be convinced they need newer,
bigger houses, and all of the trappings of capitalism will
continue.
A currency free system
!
It is possible for a society to function well with no
financial system at all. Where surplus exists, it can be
given, traded or pooled communally to ensure there is no
want of basic essentials. The argument that only primitive
societies can operate in such a fashion, our society is too
complex, is not backed by any insurmountable obstacles.
A moneyless system is unlikely to appear soon in its pure
form, but it could exist to cover at least basic essentials or
an expiring currency could be distributed as a guaranteed
periodic income which would cover basic essentials. These
options would a least ensure a society does not condemn a
child to starvation because a parent cannot provide for
them and it would relieve the pressing need to obey
corporate authority. It would allow people to follow the
path that for them provides the greatest satisfaction
without being held to corporate slavery while we create an
alternative system.
!
A great fear associated with abolishing wages or
providing anything ‘for free’ is that some people may not
work. This fear completely disregards the fact that there
have always been people who will not work under the
current system and they include the people receiving the
highest monetary rewards. Nobody worries about those
who are rich not working, just the poor. This seems to
indicate a fear of shifting social status, not a fear of people
not working. Because of the artificial monetary value
assigned to some jobs, people who elect to do demanding
and valuable work with no associated corporate wage are
sneered at as ‘welfare mothers’, etc. and made to believethey are acting as parasites on society while corporate
executives who provide no societal value are hailed as
great successes. A 2010 study showed that executives,
managers, supervisors, and financial professionals account
for about 60 percent of the top 0.1 percent of income
earners in the U.S. in recent years 29. In a system where all
work was directly tied to the product or service produced,
there would be far more societal pressure for people to do
something of direct value, and the people contributing
nothing would be exposed. With a more open system it
would also be far easier for people with current difficulties
getting work in the corporate environment to produce
something of value.
!
The internet has always had a strong anti-currency
bias. The earliest email spam promotions only served to
increase the divide between the corporate world which
took over the surface and the underground which
remained as before, populated by people derisively
referred to as parent’s basement dwellers due to the very
real truth that their work seldom brought income. The
difference between worlds is nowhere more apparent than
between Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire Facebook creator
and prodigy of the corporate world, and moot, founder of
the most wildly influential, popular and completely
unprofitable financially, website 4chan. With no financial
incentives the internet has managed to create collaborative
efforts which have pushed the potential of society far
beyond what could have been possible before the internet.
!
While it is doubtful that freeing people to obtain
basic essentials outside of corporate bondage would result
in more people than usual not working, it is very likely
that the increase in art and innovation would be dramatic.
29 Bakija, Jon, Cole, Adam, Heim, Bradley T. “Jobs and Income Growth
of Top Earners and the Causes of Changing Income Inequality: Evidence
from U.S. Tax Return Data”, Oct 2010It would also change the perception in society of the value
of volunteer work if it were necessary and open to
everyone to participate in it, and the type of work
produced would be valued by society, not corporations.
Financial independence is really our term for being able to
survive without society. What follows is the idea that if we
are independent, our contributions to society are charitable
and voluntary. This ‘independence’ is part of the system of
dissociation that stands in our way of creating a real
society.
It was once considered inconceivable that the world could run
without slavery for the exact same reasons people are now
putting forward for retaining wages, our modern slavery.An economy for all
!
It is justice, not charity, that is wanting in the world. –
Mary Wollstonecraft
!
What we are taught to think of as ‘the economy’
was defined by Aristotle in 350 B.C.E.30 as the acquisition
and use of goods for the household, and expanded to focus
on the employment of a small niche group of society who
made the accumulation and trading of assets their life’s
work. ‘Productive’ labour which adds to the value of
materials was recognized, but “The labour of a menial
servant … adds to the value of nothing.” wrote Adam
Smith in 177631. After the Industrial Revolution, Karl Marx
popularized the inclusion of labour as a commodity when
it was expended for the benefit of capitalists and
exchanged for a wage. It was separate from the labour of
daily life as “Life for him begins where this activity ceases,
at the table, at the tavern, in bed.” 32 Marx pointed out that
the exploitation of waged labour was the ultimate source
of profit and surplus value in capitalism.
!
While it was recognized at this point that workers
and slaves in capitalist industry were important parts of
the economy and were exploited by capitalism, all work
done in support of the household and community became
invisible. The exploitation of the household and
community labourer was the ultimate source of profit and
surplus value in waged labour. The exclusion of this
labour was perhaps understandable as able bodied, free
30 Aristotle, "Topics" 350 B.C.E.
31 Smith, Adam. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations, 1776.
32 Marx, Karl “Wage Labour and Capital”, 1847men were both the backbone of waged labour and the
members of the public with political power. According to
what Mary Wollstonecraft called “the divine right of
husbands” 33, women were said to be created for a man’s
pleasure and service, his children were his property and
women were not persons. Their labour was considered
rightfully his and their increased labour in his absence not
worthy of notice. Marx’s masculinist definition of both
labour and capitalist exploitation has continued to define
both.
!
The removal of waged workers from the household
increased both labour and isolation for the unpaid workers
at home and entrenched inequality and patriarchy in
households. While it was acknowledged that working for
capitalists was exploitation, women in traditional roles
were doing what they had always done so it was said to be
natural to them. Exploitation in a marriage and the worker
as a capitalist was not considered. Women were taught to
be grateful they were shielded from the exploitation of
capitalism when they were unpaid workers at home.
Equality activists in the 1970ʹ′s fought briefly to have
household work paid by western governments as an
acknowledgement of its role in supporting capitalism, but
the parallel fight for women to be more widely included in
the waged working class was far more immediately
successful. Political choice in the west now tends to
promote free trade capitalism, nationalist capitalism, or
capitalist workers. Any support for society is presented as
charity, a luxury not part of an economic system.
!
Removing women from their role as household and
community slaves ought to have created a more balanced
and enjoyable society but instead it brought far more of the
world into the trade economy once occupied by only a
small group. As the work in creating and supporting
33 Wollstonecraft, Mary, “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman”, 1792society has rarely been acknowledged and never been
valued, we have gross overproduction and gluttony in
trade and extreme poverty in service. Some look at the
overproduction in trade goods and speak of a post-scarcity
economy, where no one will have to work. Work is not
scarce, and never will be. There is always an elderly person
to visit and support, a child to care for, a garden to tend,
art to create, a world to study or a discussion to participate
in. There are homes and communities to be created, other
people to advocate for, and goods to create for necessity or
pleasure. For some, survival is a full time job while others
need assistance to survive. The time of leisure those
working in trade refer to will never exist for those creating
and supporting society.
!
Some feel that the dysfunction caused by a society
given over to trade and support of trade will be remedied
by including more women in these careers. These people
assume women are inherently more caring, giving people,
and if, for instance, women were in the military, killing
would be a kinder, gentler pastime. This is absurd, as is
proven every time women achieve those positions. Men
have also proven constantly that they are just as capable of
creating and nurturing a society as women are and prior to
the industrial revolution, those were natural roles for them
as well. The answer to the dysfunction is not gender
balance, but recognition and promotion of the roles that
create a rich and rewarding society. Gender balance should
be provided by the basic human right to choose one’s life’s
work but balance will not change the anti-social nature of a
trade economy.
!
Every society is a continuum of dependencies. With
the removal of the labour that was supporting this
continuum, dependency became another commodity for
exploitation by capitalism. People were taught to disregard
the societal debt owed for care received at the beginning of
their lives, partly as it was not labour with anacknowledged value. As it was formerly considered the
natural role of a wife to provide free labour for a husband,
it is still considered the natural role of a parent to provide
free care for their children. Adults were now considered
dissociated from their origins. The propaganda taught that
since they didn’t ask to be born they owed nothing to
society.
!
Oddly this lack of obligation for things one didn’t
ask for did not extend to aging, sickness or disaster. Now it
was incumbent on each labourer to hoard the assets they
would need for ‘independence’, a state where they were
dissociated from the assistance of society. This
‘independence’ filled lives with fear, uncertainty and
doubt and fed massive insurance and charity industries
which provide no real service at all. These industries
provide an illusion of independence by blocking and
allocating access to societal support that has been present
all along such as medical care and assistance from society
in emergencies. The independence is false, but the
dissociation serves to make some feel entitled and others
not.
!
While trade economy is only possible if the rest of
society is doing the creation and support work, society can
exist quite well without trade. We have conducted society
as a trade relationship to an intolerable degree since
international trade became widespread until it now defines
every aspect of society. Capitalism has progressed to the
point where only a few control the lives of most of the
world, an unsustainable imbalance. We can rewind
economy based on trade relationships to a point where
many will again benefit from it, by debt jubilee, financial
collapse or other, or we can create a new post-industrial
economy that benefits all members of society and supports
the roles society needs.Decentralized trade economies
!
Peer-to-peer trading is being increasingly explored
as a method to cut out corporate control of the trade
economy. Peer to peer trading looks like the diagram
above. People can trade directly with each other, or
through a network, eliminating the central hubs that
control distribution and block access of goods. An
alternative distribution is the gift economy. It follows a
similar diagram but does not involve direct exchange.
Instead, goods are given and it is hoped that equivalent
goods will be returned. A common model to discourage
freeloading in a gift economy is to require a certain level of
contribution from each member.!
The peer-to-peer / gift economy structure is
encouraged as a form of trade suitable to a non-
hierarchical society. That depiction is based on an incorrect
picture of the society those trading nodes belong to. The
difference between a trade relationship and a society with
dependencies is obvious to those dependent or unequal in
society. Anyone unable to trade an object or act of direct
value to a person in power will be left out of a trade
network and dependent on charity as shown in the
following chart. The peer to peer model eliminates the
corporate hierarchy but leaves the patriarchy alive and
well.
!
Peer-to-peer and gift economies do not allow for
society’s input to be inherent in the trade transactions. The
value of goods traded is rarely created solely by the trader.
Some production builds on previous work, some makes
use of assets from the commons and some is produced at
the expense of work left for others. Some products may
violate human rights of others or damage the environment
or the society. Trade relationships relate only to
negotiations between individuals and do not reflect impact
on an entire society.!
Power in peer to peer and gift economies is
retained by those that control assets. Not only does this not
benefit all of the people who historically don’t benefit in
capitalism, it is easy in the diagram below to see how the
cycle will progress right back to where we are today as
wealth will again concentrate in those who hoard assets
and avoid caring for dependents. Peer to peer trade
relationships are simply decentralized capitalism. Bringing
that system back to its origins with no change will
certainly produce the same result over time which it has
produced now.
!
In the preceding diagram, the two traders who
have pooled their resources and have no dependents are
the most powerful. The one with six dependents is
working far harder and obliged to divide their assets by
seven. The disabled individual all by himself, and the one
supporting twelve children and two elderly parents cannotparticipate in the trade economy at all and are dependent
on charity. Their needs are not inherent in a trade economy.
!
For every member of society who has something of
outside value to trade, there are dependents who have
nothing and others doing the internal society building
work. All trade must benefit those powerful enough to
reciprocate. People providing palliative or geriatric care,
working with the mentally ill or children, or with criminals
not participating in the economy, will have no means of
survival except charity or a resurrection of the institutional
structures described earlier. Those whose own survival
takes all of their available resources because of illness,
disability or age, those investing years in a long term
project with no observable output, or those working in
research and other thought based fields also have no
inherent value in a peer to peer structure and must have
their needs tacked on as a charitable addendum or debt
obligation.
!
In September 2012, an article appeared in a
Canadian newspaper. 34 It told the story of a very young
woman in Uganda raising six children, all the product of
rape, after being abducted at 13 to become a child soldier.
The photojournalist gave her a camera and sold the photos
she took with it. When he gave her the money, he said
“This isn’t a handout. This is money you’ve earned.”
!
Consider that for one minute. Raising six children
she did not ask for while still a teenager herself, being
pregnant or recovering for six years, breast feeding all of
these children for however many years, providing food,
shelter, clothing, safety, medical, educational and other
care, all 24 hours a day, seven days a week while in
extremely dangerous and uncomfortable conditions and
recovering from severe trauma, with no societal support
34 Ellison, Marc. "Former Child Soldiers in Uganda Have Renewed Hope for
Future." The Star, 9 Sept. 2012and in fact in danger from society, was not worth payment.
She is expected to sacrifice her health and risk her life for a
job that was not worth payment. Surviving all the trauma
of her life did not entitle her to support from society.
Trading a picture was considered providing something of
value and contributing to society. This is a society
conducted as a trade relationship. If she was raising
livestock, she would be compensated. She cannot sell her
children, therefore her work for them is of no value. It
would however be illegal for her to let them die, so she is
legally slave labour. Slavery of caregivers and others in this
and many other instances is the only reason societies
under capitalism can survive.
!
There are many groups today advocating living a
money free existence by using barter, scavenging, peer-to-
peer trade and gift economies. Women have been living a
money free existence for most of history. Women devote a
year of their lives to each pregnancy and recovery period
and still do by far the most society building and caregiving
work worldwide. In trade economies they have to add
additional labour on top of this to create some product of
exchange that will appeal to a person in power or they and
all of their dependents will be at the mercy of those in
power. The peer-to-peer barter or ‘gift’ economy required
for many to survive has been called the world’s oldest
profession: prostitution in an endless variety of forms,
many called marriage. Trade economies are rigged against
women in traditional roles and anyone else creating or
supporting society. The answer for equality in this system
has been for everyone to reject support roles and embrace
trade economies.
!
Peer-to-peer networks provide no improvement for
the rights of the weak as shown by a history full of peer-to-
peer extortion gangs, human trafficking networks and
brotherly
revolutions
which
became
tyrannical
immediately upon seizing power. Peer-to-peer is a survivalof the fittest structure which ensures slavery of the weak.
The persecution of the weak found in societies without
inherent protection is frequently followed by a guardian
coup d’état as when women are legally barred from
bending over in Swaziland35, sitting astride motorbikes in
Indonesia36 or owning cell phones in rural India 37 for their
own ‘protection’. In a society with a trade based economy,
currency and centralized power offers more protection to
the weak than a peer-to-peer structure. This has been seen
by the improvement in women’s lives when they have the
right to vote and work for pay, and protection is provided
(however theoretically) by the state.
!
When asked how they would allow for
dependencies, advocates of peer to peer or gift economies
speak of being ‘generous’, ‘giving’ food to the less able,
and nearly always also mention condemnation for anyone
having more children than they can provide for
themselves, addictions, etc. In fact even one child puts the
pregnant, nursing and responsible parent at a huge
disadvantage and causes them to have to work far harder,
for far less, and then need to divide their earnings. A
number of dependents like six or more makes it difficult to
survive. Many people around the world have many more
than six children as well as care for other dependents in
society. Even if the birth rate were reduced, every state in
the northern hemisphere is experiencing an explosion in
the elderly population, and disasters, environmental harm

37 Singh, Mahim Pratap, "Udaipur Muslim Panchayat Bans Mobiles for
Girls." The Hindu, 11 Jan 2013and other factors can cause sudden huge increases in
dependents.
!
The decentralized capitalist structures treat this
‘problem’, in very much the same way as their corporate
capitalist predecessors, with a begrudging charity or more
hostile superiority and blame for those disadvantaged by
their system. The value attached to trade versus creation
and support of society is evident in every part of life, from
obnoxious business travelers and others treating child
caregivers as an untouchable caste to the removal of the
elderly and less able to a dependent, burdensome role
instead of recognizing the contributions and effort they are
still providing or could. The nostalgia for a time before
rampant corporate capitalism took hold, when ‘everyone’
benefited from peer-to-peer trade is an entirely masculinist
view with a very narrow definition of ‘everyone’. As the
male role in society has expanded to include far more
caregiving, a trade economy suits no one.
!
Societies have never been shy about dictating what
type of person should become a mother or the behaviour
expected once someone becomes a mother, but these
pressures are not shared by the rest of society. While the
mother is expected to be an impossible paragon, modern
societies feel no obligation to provide a safe and
welcoming, educational and nurturing environment. A
mother that does not love her child is considered an
abomination. A society that does not love its children is
considered natural and justified.
!
The right to have children or not is an individual
right of women only. The children, once born, are the
responsibility of society, primarily through support of
parenthood. In modern society, people are no longer
accustomed to the idea that they are responsible to a
society of people. While they will easily accept
responsibility for a road that they may or may not use, a
person without children has been taught to feel robbed byresponsibility for a school. In a society of plenty, children
are no longer presented as the support of the future but
simply as the burden of the present.
!
People are paid to kill, not to give birth. While the
right to suicide is contested, the responsibility to provide
care for the elderly and ill while they choose to live is not
up for debate. They are not told that since the choice to live
is theirs, the responsibility must also be fully theirs. Society
accepts that adults have the right to choose whether to live
and yet is willing to support their life. Society does not
fully accept that women have the right to give birth (or
not) and yet places full responsibility for the child on the
woman who chose to give birth.
Exploitation of dependents as a commodity
!
In a world where everything is bought and sold, the
weak become the product.
!
The elderly are taught to live in fear of outliving
their rights to care or even a home and food, and the
pressure to hoard everything for the time when they can
no longer work hangs over the
lives of every worker.
Since no one can know when they will become ill, when
they will die, or what the vagaries of the financial system
will bring, this stress colours the lives of everyone in
society and makes generosity with any current surplus
unlikely.
!
Insurance corporations which provide nothing of
real value to society have sprung up for every eventuality
and advertise potential calamity incessantly. The fearful
society then buys insurance instead of using their surplus
to help others experiencing a current disaster. Sometimes
this protection racket is mandated by law and it is
impossible to drive a car, mortgage a house or otheractivities without paying an insurance company selling
fear.
!
Sickness is controlled not only by the insurance
companies but by the health industry which controls
choice. The wealthy can afford real health solutions in the
form of healthy lifestyles and expensive testing,
counseling, therapy and remedies. The poor are either
denied health care or fed the most harmful and invasive
quick-fix pharmaceuticals and procedures with little to no
after care or general wellness assistance. Poor health is
considered an individual responsibility despite frequently
or usually being caused by societal pollution, poor
nutritional options, unsafe environments, etc.
!
Caregivers are threatened with no hope for their
child’s future if they are not provided with an endless
array of products and services tiered by income to
determine future status in society. The education
caregivers are convinced is necessary for a child to succeed
is only necessary to perpetuate the trade economy. The
poor are streamed to schools which teach the futility of
resistance38 and the reality that elite options will never be
available39 to them. The wealthy are taught to excel in arts,
athletics and academics to no purpose except to appear
accomplished in the manner of the old aristocracy.
Character and how to benefit the society they are born
into, the topics which may be expected to be the only
necessary topics for a state education, are almost never
taught.

Young adults are persuaded they must mortgage
their futures before beginning them by entering

sold 40 in a similar manner. Governments or agents charge
fees for emigrating labour which ensures they will be
enslaved by the purchased job for years. This ensures
workers can never leave the trade economy as they are
indentured for years, captured first by paying for the
privilege of working, second by fears for retirement.
!
However reasonable a legal system may seem,
lawyers and an arbitrary system of judicial discretion
ensure that the laws work against the poor. It does not
matter if the law is on the side of the poor if a rich
opponent drags the process out for years and bankrupts
them, or ensures they cannot keep up with the legal
process or they do not have the expertise or time to fight.
Civil courts have succeeded for years in destroying the
lives of those the law should have protected by protracted
lawsuits and exorbitant fees. Now many countries are
seeing pre-trial detentions41 abused in the same manner
and prisoners denied their rights to a speedy trial.

Once in prison, people become part of a huge
predatory industry42. Taxes pay private or state owned
corporations set up to warehouse prisoners not rehabilitate
them. Many prisons worldwide have the added feature of

Disasters which require voluntary assistance are
preyed upon by NGO’s who build powerful empires 44 by
standing between those in need and the society willing to
help them. ‘Rebuilding’ efforts are typically an
opportunity for multinational corporations to come in and

other disaster, is a signal for the ‘rebuilding’48 efforts of

Wide spread and growing human trafficking49 is a
product of a society built on trade relationships. Preying
particularly on the weakest members of society, human
traffickers also frequent disaster areas looking for those
who will not be easily traced. People are captured and sold
for pedophiles50, prostitution51 , slavery52, military53, organ
harvesting54 and even ritual killings55 where their body
parts are said to bring wealth and power to the purchaser.

The poor are exploited by capitalism through
uncountable fees, fines, and price gouging. When they
receive money it is subject to a vast array of charges from
the financial industry, for cashing cheques, fines for missed
payments, interest on debt, and a wide assortment of
tiered services such as credit cards which are impossibly
expensive for the poor but provide benefits to the rich.
Stores will raise the prices of essentials on days when
benefits are paid to ensure the poor pay more. In many
cases poor people are expected to ‘volunteer’ in exchange
for food or lodging in yet another form of modern slavery.

In a trade economy, dependency is a product to be
exploited and sold to society for maximum profit.
Approval economy
!
To benefit all of society, an economy needs to be
based on service to all of society. In today’s economy,
service is bought and sold as a good. Instead goods must
be provided as a service. An economy benefitting all of
society should include service to ourselves, service to
others and service to society at large. An elderly person
who keeps themselves healthy and fulfilled or an addict
working to conquer their addiction may be giving only to
themselves but both are making society a much better
place and lessening the work for others. To create a giving
economy instead of a gift economy, exchange is not
between two trading partners. Societal approval is
awarded from all of society to the giver. Societal approval
and trust then entitles each member of a society to receive
benefit from that society, through a living and immediate
social contract. As a reputation economy allows you to
participate in trade, an approval economy allows you to
become part of a society.
!
Trade economies attempt to symbolically represent
societal approval by possessions. As monarchs were
formerly held to rule by divine right, trade economies
insist wealth is due to virtue. While hoarded possessions
have been used as a symbol of acceptance, they do not
fulfill the real social need for acceptance. The wealthy are
instead resented and isolated, shunned by the society they
supposedly are the elite members of. Underlying every
patriarchal society is the idea that caregivers, children anddependents should be grateful as trade economies see
them as burdensome. Those who see a disparity in labour
for the family and community are not at all grateful. Wage
earners resent not gaining love and approval for their
work in trade but because trade economy derides unpaid
service, they receive no respect for support and creation of
the society either. In a trade economy, the currency
exchanged separates the giver and receiver. Because the
currency entitles the receiver to the gift they are not
grateful. The human need for social and familial approval
is almost never adequately met in trade economies.
!
As possessions in a trade economy include the
service of others, those who do not work for the benefit of
others are the powerful. An economy based on societal
approval equates not working for others with being
excluded or shunned. In an approval based economy,
control of assets does not bring power. Assets are not
assigned worth until they are contributed to the society.
Internal support contributions are not valued less than
external trade contributions.
!
Work in an approval based economy provides
society and affinity groups. It is less stressful to be part of
the society than to be isolated. Gifts are bonding, both
within family and friends and at a community level. In an
approval economy gifts are not a tax or state confiscation
which leaves nothing. Wealth is created by giving.
Acceptance by society is based on actions instead of assets.
Those dependent in society for some things also have gifts
to give, acceptance and approval being the most valuable.
Politicians propped up by military and corporate interests
hated by the people are the antithesis of societal approval
as the mark of acceptance. The dissociation of power in
society from service to society provides fertile ground for
sociopaths to seize power.
!
Those creating and supporting society should not
need charity, they should have power. An inclusive societydoes not leave some dependent on the charity of others, or
make some work far harder for the same ends. Where
there is inequality there will always be tyrants. Giving
birth, aging or accepting responsibility for another should
not be equivalent to accepting a slave role. ‘Women’s
issues’, the elderly, the youth and the less able cannot be
special problems to be dealt with on the fringes of society.
Care for dependents of society is the responsibility of all,
and dependents should have power to gift approval to
those who assist them. Economy cannot be rigged to
favour one special interest group. The solutions for all of
society must be inherent within the economic system. In an
approval economy, effort to benefit society is recognized
and acts against society are penalized. Approval is related
to assessment of fairness, not the value of the gift. The
work of an elderly person talking to a child, a scientist
conducting research, a maker providing goods, a child
learning and a mentally less able person gardening have
no value differences, though the effort expended might.

In the chart below, the person with a score of 91 has
decided to be a pillar of their society. They probably belong
to few other societies, and devote formidable energy to
providing for this one, belonging to many working and
discussion groups and making themselves available and
responsible for the wellbeing of others. The people scored
58 and 52 may be just visiting or may belong to many
networks or perhaps they prefer to spend their days on the
beach, doing only the basic amount necessary for good
standing. They may be entitled to basic essentials like food
and lodging but not community resources such as cars and
maker labs without additional barter. 55 and 50 expend
effort, but also cause harm. Perhaps they are struggling
with addiction or mental illness. Their effort is recognized
by continued support but at basic levels to restrict their
ability to harm others. The person scored at 15 is probablycompletely shunned

An approval economy is the economy people rely
on when they do not use direct coercion, the one typically
seen in families and unfunded cooperative and volunteer
groups. What the approval ratings mean in terms of
benefits earned and whether there are formal values at all
varies by society. Being part of a society may require more
effort at some times than at others. For instance, not
assisting to put out a fire or provide emergency aid to
another may be considered an act against society rather
than simply a failure to contribute. The benefits of
belonging to a society will dictate how motivated people
are to contribute to it.
Acceptance and shunning
!
Acts which cost society should reduce the standing
of the destroyer and their access to benefits. Theft reduces
the thief’s approval which is their wealth. Acts ofaggression against society is reflected back to harm the
aggressor’s standing and remove power and privilege.
Extreme aggression in violation of the social contract
results in shunning, or removal from the benefits of society.
Every person has a right to belong to a society except in
extreme cases as complete shunning can be equivalent to a
death sentence. Law enforcement by shunning is inherent
in a system of trust networks. In dissociated trade
economies, criminals are allowed to fully participate in
society until a point when they are completely removed
from society. Societal approval and rehabilitation have
nothing to do with punishment in a trade economy. Far
from being shunned, many criminals are media celebrities
or enjoy wide-spread societal support.
!
Acceptance or reintegration into society in an
approval economy is a product of subsequent good
behaviour and effort expended to increase approval. A
person who has lost their good standing would be forced
into a trade economy relationship to receive any benefits
and have to ‘pay up front’ rather than have the rights of a
member of society. Shunning would ensure that laws were
true reflections of popular opinion, though shunning must
never be used to remove the rights in a social contract by
mob rule.
!
Societies can join in expanded networks which may
agree to trust individual reputations across the network.
These networks can also agree to shun other societies they
do not approve of or assist those they do. Those societies
that do not join expanded networks do not receive the
benefits of them. People that have good standing across
multiple networks can increase their standing in each by
providing referrals and knowledge or some networks
might agree to blend rankings to create an overall
reputation. In this way people who do not work locally can
still access the essentials they need locally. An expanded
network would also provide an avenue of appeal if aperson felt their local society was shunning them unjustly
or they were having their basic human rights violated.
Expanded networks which create apartheid would violate
basic human rights which must be considered above the
rights of any group.
!
The trust networks and reputations which make up
an approval economy are part of the daily life of all
societies already. The people you invite to eat a dinner you
have provided are typically people who have earned your
trust and approval. They will usually provide similar
benefits to you if they are able, and if they consistently do
not they may begin to receive less invitations. We care for
grandparents who are unable to reciprocate because we
recognize ourselves as part of a continuum of family
obligation which cared for us when we were young and
will hopefully do so again when we are old. When we ask
the identity of an absent group member, their reputation
and approval rating is frequently implied in the answer,
and sometimes we ask for referrals outright. Even as
anonymous participants on some internet sites our input is
ranked and voted up and down, contributing to our
reputation. Sometimes our internet reputation is already
used to introduce us to wider societies providing basic
needs, such as couchsurfing.
!
Approval economies are the natural economies of
human society. We separated power from societal approval
and exchanged society for trade relationships so long ago
most cannot imagine an alternative, but it is still there in
the most basic units of society. Economies based on trade
relationships with financial systems as tools of coercion
and control cannot coexist with peaceful and just societies.
Power will be concentrated in able bodied traders and
hoarders as long as we continue using trade economies.Beyond nation states
!
Governments now are run by hierarchical groups
which act as the final authority on all topics for an entire
region for an arbitrarily specified length of time or until
they are overthrown by another group. What these
authorities govern is a series of systems, controlled by the
state or corporations. Systems covering everything from
health care to community infrastructure have profit and
control for the top of the hierarchy as their objectives. They
are not set up to provide an efficient or superior service or
product to the users. They do not accept input from the
users in any meaningful manner. Currently voters elect
representatives by regional boundaries but in reality most
decisions and actions are taken by ministries or private
corporations divided by function, not region. If each
system was governed by its own user group, every person
would belong to many overlapping or separate systems
each with their own culture and governance, similar to the
different levels of regional governance now.
!
The current political structure does not recognize
that every system is not of concern or interest to everyone
in the region or that many systems are of far wider concern
than one state. We need responsibility and control
(governance and ownership) to rest with the entire user
group and functionality for the entire user group, not
profit or power, should be the objective. If individual
rights and the rights of global commons are accepted as
being paramount, every user group should, subject only to
these conditions, be entitled to govern themselves. Each
user group should consist of all people affected by the
system and no people not affected by the system. The
debate around who the user group of each system is would
be the most challenging aspect of this type of governance.!
Contribution at all levels of each system must be
open to all users. Expertise can be assessed and acquired in
concentric user groups, and work can be contributed and
accepted or rejected by stigmergy. Having all German
federal law and regulations on GitHub is a great idea, but
only if pull requests are allowed from the people affected
by the laws of Germany. An open working group allows
people to work on anything they like. They are not
required to submit resumes and acquire accreditation,
seniority, or approval from an individual authority. If their
work is good enough it will be accepted by the user group.
Everyone can work on the system that interests them,
doing the jobs at the level they are capable of, with as
much or as little involvement as they choose. If the worker
is also part of the user group, the benefits to themselves are
immediate and obvious. The most effective way to prevent
producer and consumer conflict of interests is to eliminate
separation between the two. The farmer who eats their
own food has an interest in producing healthy food.
!
All information related to the system must be fully
transparent in order for users to participate in tasks or
auditing and to learn how to contribute. Transparency
allows every user of the system to explain to anyone
interested what is being developed and why, how to
contribute and any other information new users require.
Transparency allows users to act as the knowledge bridges
to train new users.
!
Some people seeking new economic alternatives
are pushing to have ownership of property abolished or
severely restricted. It is of course, completely within the
power of a society to remove property from individuals,
corporations or anyone else and also to change the laws
which allowed property ownership. It has certainly been
done before many times in past societies. Like oligarchies,
property ownership does not tend to stay away when it is
removed. Usually ownership removed from an individualis transferred to a group. To see the problems inherent in
this, we only need to look back at the problems with
corporatist groups and hidden oligarchies. These issues
with abolishing ownership have been demonstrated in the
past by many alternative societies which battled cult
leaders attempting to seize ownership or control of
surrendered property.
!
Property ownership defined as rights to property
always exists. Abolishing property ownership only hides
it. Ownership as the right to possess, preserve, rent, sell,
use, give away, or destroy property most logically
accompanies governance as a right of the user group.
Governance as the decision making and management of a
system by those with the right to do so and property
ownership defined as the rights and responsibilities
associated with specific property are used interchangeably
here as they ought to be inseparable.
!
Property ownership causes problems when control of
property is held outside of the user group. When a community
owns an individual’s home, an individual owns a community’s
public space, or a state lays claim to an ocean, problems are
inevitable.
Personal integrity
!
In order to create a healthy society which can reach
its full potential, we must start with healthy individuals
who can reach their full potential. Each person ought to
have ownership and authority over all matters which
affect only their own person. This is not simple.
!
Each person has the right to control over their own
body. Illness can sometimes change the functioning of a
brain and cause a person to make decisions they would not
have made before the illness. Which then is the officialauthority to reference, what is the point at which a person
loses their own decision making ability, who makes that
decision and who then takes control of decision making for
that body?
!
Sometimes a body is shared by two or more
identities. Rarely in the case of conjoined twins and
frequently in the case of pregnancy, two lives are affected
by the decisions over one body. In the case of pregnancy, a
commonly held view in countries with legal abortion is
that both lives are the mother’s to control until the fetus is
capable of autonomous life. Some will argue that only the
person pregnant is entitled to an opinion and others that
the unborn child also has rights. Still others will argue the
loss of a potential child in the future gives the father or
society a vote as well. If the child has rights over the body,
is the mother guilty of attempted murder if she attempts
suicide? Negligence if she has a car accident? If so, is she
also negligent for lifestyle choices before pregnancy which
may have damaged eggs? What if the pregnancy was
accidental? And is the father also negligent for unhealthy
sperm? For those who feel the mother never has the right
to terminate a pregnancy, even if her life is at risk, how
does the fetus then have the right to terminate the
mother’s life? What are the start and end points of life in
the timeline between potential conception and potential
resurrection?
!
There are very convincing arguments for many
answers to these questions, which will have to rely in large
part on what the underlying principles of individual rights
are accepted to be. These are decisions which will have to
be defined in the social contract of each society. If a society
decides abortion is solely a woman’s choice, it would be
impossible to then argue that a state could require women
to have an internal ultrasound prior to the abortion. If the
situation is defined as within her user group only, then
only she makes all of the decisions for it.!
No one can own another person. Human trafficking
and all forms of the slave trade have been considered
abhorrent all over the world for years. A child requires
special care as they cannot be autonomous at birth. If the
parents do not own the child, what is it that gives them
more right than another to raise the child? Is there a
separate social contract that applies to members of a family
where they agree to care for each other ahead of the rest of
society? It would make sense to think of each person as
belonging to many societies, some small enough to be
considered relationships, others large enough to
encompass all of earth or the universe. Each society would
have its own agreement of mutual obligations,
dependency and respect, forming its own social contract.
!
Living life to its full potential does entail taking
risks. A society that promises to remove all insecurity is
crippling the freedom and challenge required to reach full
potential. Personal risk is personal choice, until
responsibility for the repercussions of that risk fall on the
rest of society. Consumption of drugs alone is a personal
decision; consumption of drugs while driving a vehicle in
public involves everyone who may be harmed.
Consumption of drugs in the home may also involve other
people in the home, and health systems the drug user
relies on may have input as well.
!
The right to defend oneself is found in a state of
nature, but freedom from living life as prey is a primary
motivation for leaving a state of nature to enter society.
The physical reaction of fear, revulsion and stress from
being stalked or under constant threat does not allow for
the peace of mind necessary for freedom. If a society is
beneficial, its role is to protect each member against not
just violent assault but also the constant threat and
reasonable fear of assault. When the right to defend
overwhelms the right to feel secure a society is at war with
itself and not functioning as a refuge.!
The right for freedom of expression or action stops
being an individual decision at the point where it harms
the freedom of another. Free speech when used to prevent
or inhibit the speech of another becomes censorship. State
censorship interferes with freedom of speech for all but
hate speech primarily attacks only vulnerable groups. The
right to produce and broadcast violence has been allowed
to overwhelm the right of vulnerable populations to feel
secure. In most countries, propaganda against vulnerable
groups has caused violence and in some it has even caused
attempted genocide. In the past, the right to ‘freedom of
the press’ has been forced on sovereign states so that
wealthy foreign press can overwhelm the society with
foreign propaganda. This can serve as a form of censorship
by misinformation and noise, drowning out the voices of
others. Social media has provided an effective counter to
such attempts lately and is beginning to regulate
censorship by hate speech as well.
!
Invasion of privacy has been conveniently defined
by groups such as reddit administrators and moderators to
protect the names of men posting creepshots but not the
naked bodies of women and children posted to the
website. The rights of paparazzi to freedom of speech have
been allowed to completely overwhelm the rights of
women with public jobs to privacy or security. This also
infringes on women’s freedom of speech and ability to
pursue power. The right to information about actions
which affect the public has been transformed into the right
to invade the privacy of any person the media deems
newsworthy. Revenge porn and creep shots imply
ownership of the woman, child porn violates the dignity of
the child. The reaction of paparazzi defending their creep
shots of Kate Middleton by saying she should not be
‘ashamed of her body’ denied her ownership and
authority over her own privacy. Those who argue thatsimply viewing child porn or other unwilling porn does no
harm are denying the harm of a violation to privacy.
!
Privacy and ownership of personal stories are
closely related to human dignity. Violation of these rights
is commonly associated with degradation and humiliation.
The importance of these rights to our well-being is
highlighted by the number of suicides among people
humiliated by gossip or other invasions of their human
dignity and by the existence of shame as a human emotion.
The difference between rape and any other physical
assault is this added violation. When authoritarians
attempt to humiliate those they seek control over, they
violate ownership and authority in these areas. We see this
more and more as states demand greater control, starting
with strip searches and ‘cavity searches’ (rape) of
vulnerable populations like prisoners and now widespread
to the general population of the world.
!
The public side of personal stories is reputation, an
intangible possession of great value to humans. While
jealousy and pride are not generally considered virtues,
they are essential motivators and guides to a person’s
behaviour. Pride and shame are the built-in methods of
coercion societies use to encourage certain types of
behaviour in people. All that goes into a person’s
reputation contributes to their acceptance and approval in
society. Societal approval is a far more powerful tool of
governance than military might. A person must have the
right to protect their reputation from unwarranted malice
or theft as it is used to purchase their acceptance in society.
!
While individual rights applied equally for all is a
sufficient principle in some cases, sometimes there are
conflicting priorities and needs. Each of these situations is
open to endless nuance and it must be the choice of local
governance to define their own customs. Individual rights
need to ensure consideration and respect for all. Those that
are decrepit or ill, those that are not fully matured, thosethat can give birth, those that are raising children or are in
other ways directly responsible for the wellbeing of others
must be protected as well as the general population
without special interest groups having to form and lobby
for their voices to be amplified. In defining all rights,
special care must be taken that those rights will not
infringe on the rights of others. In this way systems which
respect individual rights can operate autonomously
knowing they are causing no harm to others.
Personal property
!
It is sometimes extremely hard to separate people
from their childhood blanket, favourite shirt, or in
adulthood, first car, and ultimately home. History shows a
natural trait of humans, like ravens, to become bonded
with physical objects. There is commonly felt delight in
finding and creating objects and many people have
keepsakes that they use to trigger memories of a loved
person, time or place. There is also commonly felt jealousy
and clashes over possessions. In some people, an
attachment to possessions can become a crippling disorder.
Others have managed to forsake all feelings of attachment.
It is difficult to generalize to what extent possessions may
be tied to happiness, but it is readily apparent that almost
all people possess more objects than they can easily care
for and the ownership causes more stress than
contentment.
! Personal property must be considered a natural right as
few mammals will not feel they are attacked if their
property (such as food and shelter) is taken. The right to
personal property has been enshrined in almost every
political system and body of law as well as in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 17, and in
the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 1.John Locke went as far as to say "The reason why men enter
into society is the preservation of their property”56 and The
Communist Manifesto allowed "hard-won, self-acquired, self-
earned"57 property not based on the labour of others.
! If a society agrees that slavery must not exist then
property as a result of labour can only belong to the
labourer. A gift of labour to the community must then
result in approval and enhanced reputation and acceptance
for the labourer, not any other group or individual. The
right to ownership or credit for the results of labour may
be considered a right of personal integrity as it contributes
to reputation and societal approval. Societal approval is
not just a basic need of all humans, it may be an economic
necessity in an approval based economy. Credit or
property ownership unclaimed does not disperse, we have
proven it goes to feed a form of capitalism where all
unclaimed credit or property will feed an oligarch. The
safest way to avoid such unjust oligarchy is to simply leave
credit or ownership in the place they originate and trust
the lure of societal approval to encourage sharing of
surplus. Appropriate credit allocation is part of
transparency and information the public needs in order to
govern themselves.
!
Personal property can at times extend to body parts
or enhancements in which case the sole user group is the
person wearing or using the property. If ownership is by
user group they must also be the owner. Property such as
shelter may be tied to personal security and also have a
sole user. These possessions only create conflict if they are
scarce and deplete community resources until there is not
equivalent property available for all. Property acquired by
labour may also use scarce resources in the case of a
56 Locke, John, Second Treatise on Civil Government, 1690
57 Marx, Karl, Engels, Friedrich, “The Communist Manifesto”, Feb 1848garden or similar enhanced value. The allocation of scarce
property must be a decision for local governance and
would probably be tied to either societal approval or
relative need. The homesteading principle of ownership by
the first person to claim a property implies that earlier
ownership did not exist. Ownership always exists,
unclaimed property belongs to the commons. Ownership
must then be given by the user group of the commons, not
seized. The same applies to intangible property such as
concepts, it is for the user group to decide who to allocate
credit to, not for an individual to file copyright or patent
claims.
!
An antipathy to gluttony and waste is a fairly
universal feeling which most of the world is ignoring.
Creation can bring great joy and fulfillment, but
overproduction of goods encourages people to destroy and
waste their property instead of becoming attached to it. If
personal property is the result of either the owner’s labour
or a gift from someone it is far less likely to be wasted or
overproduced. In a system where the essentials of life are
provided for free and there is no need for people to
perform work that does not appeal to them, it is likely that
few will elect to make maintenance of another’s assets
their life’s work. If maintenance of assets becomes the sole
responsibility of the owner, excessive property ownership
will quickly become a burden instead of a privilege. If each
person is allocated the right to dispose of only a limited
amount of waste, it would also curb overproduction.
!
The world today combines the ability to easily
provide basic essentials for everyone on earth with very
little labour and an unprecedented ability to live lightly. A
room full of stereo equipment, libraries full of books,
precious family photos and papers, legal documentation,
letters, banks and so much more are all accessible from a
borrowed smart phone. With very few items that are either
precious or uncommon, in the way that a book before theprinting press was both precious and uncommon, or cloth
before looms, acquiring, hoarding and guarding property
seems more and more a futile vocation.
!
In response to any anti-consumer revulsion, there
are policies of forced ownership in some countries,
especially in North America. Insurance and liability which
discourage sharing, a refusal to build bike lanes or provide
reasonable public transit, and ‘safety standards’ which
require the constant disposal of perfectly functioning
assets, even including items as large as houses and cars,
overcome our natural antipathy to waste.
!
Children are given lifelong back injuries to ensure
that they continue to buy paper and books instead of
putting their school supplies on a tablet. Families are
threatened with the loss of their children if they do not live
in a house deemed large enough and built with all of the
government required features. People are forbidden to
share their accommodation with others by a variety of
regulations at all levels of government. Food which cannot
be used by stores and restaurants is poisoned with bleach
rather than let it be used by freegans or food banks. Many
laws are now being attempted which prevent the growing,
preparing, or sharing of food by anyone ‘unlicensed’ or
inhibit the ability of people to provide this basic need for
themselves or others. Desperate advertising is needed to
continue to convince people they need possessions which
simply burden them.
!
Not following the natural impulse of attachment to
material goods creates a disposable culture that humans
are not naturally comfortable with. From the moment the
first human picked up a rock and took it home to play with
or share, we have been attached to inanimate objects. We
like to create and gift giving cultures world wide have
evolved with the delight of sharing material property.
Corporate culture has served to separate people from their
attachment to objects, to encourage hoarding as anownership culture instead of a sharing one, and to devalue
property by a glut of goods.
!
With greater internet communication, people are
connecting cerebrally around ideas and traveling more to
meet more people outside of their economic circles. Here
economic disparity introduces awkwardness and is a
barrier unless sharing becomes part of the expected
behaviour in the circle. It is not enjoyable to have what
your peers cannot. The ability to drive to a restaurant and
eat an expensive meal by yourself while your friends are
all making dinner in a park does not allow for the social
life which most people crave. For many years, the solution
to this dilemma was to create societies based on
corresponding wealth. Within each physical location the
very rich built guarded fortresses and they created
enclaves for shopping, eating, living etc., which only they
could afford. This way they are not put to the discomfort
of being economically isolated from the rest of their
community.
!
As the economic disparity grows wider, the need
for stronger barricades and greater isolation of the
enclaves increases. As the numbers of very poor increase
and very rich decrease, and as the middle class buffer of
sycophants and servants disappears, the isolation and
paranoia in the very rich will add to the pressure and
decrease the attractiveness of belonging to this society.
While some may simply build higher walls, others are
likely to question their society and explore more attractive
alternatives.
Community commons
!
Today’s so-called nation states are nothing of the
sort. They are economic markets designed to ensure
unequal distribution of wealth. No state is now a purenation by ethnicity, religious belief, or any other common
factor except economic opportunity. Moving from one state
to another is no longer a significant cultural journey.
Nations in a pure sense do not exist. When state leaders
speak of ‘our values’ it is a meaningless phrase since every
state now has diverse values. ‘Our way of life’ is a far more
honest description.
!
Society is built not by ethnic origin or citizenship
but by shared values outlined in a social contract. Any
society should be free to join by any individual who agrees
to abide by the social contract. A political structure which
rejects discrimination based on racism, sexism, ageism,
and all other forms of collective shunning yet embraces
nationalism is overdue for collapse. An apartheid world is
no more logical, sustainable or moral than an apartheid
state.
!
If communities were organized by society, there
would be no need for militant policing of borders as there
is when they are organized by economic opportunity. It
would be far easier for a society to reach consensus on
shared values and a social contract all supported if they
were already arranged by affinity group. Our current
system of dividing people by land mass ensures we will
never be able to govern by consensus and must have the
warring political parties and win/lose governance of
representative or direct democracy. Acceptance of a social
contract would be a true acceptance if our naturally
migratory species had the right to join whatever society or
societies best suited them. There would be no need for
external forces to protect human rights if every society was
open to be left or joined. No person should be subjected to
the law of a society whose social contract they did not
accept, they can only be shunned from that society. No
child must be subjected to the laws of the social contract
unless they have reached an age of informed acceptance.!
Acceptance of a social contract means it is not
collective punishment if that society is shunned by others.
When sanctions are applied to economic regions by land
mass, as they are to Iran, North Korea and Cuba, it is
collective punishment and a war crime. Global pressure on
societies is far more reasonable if they have willingly
accepted the values the rest of the world objects to.
!
Governance by society would allow the adoption of
methods and principles not in common use today.
Alternative economic systems or living structures could be
explored in small communities and the ones that appeared
attractive would spread to other societies. The world
would not need to all adhere to the same methods and
principles except in matters involving other communities.
!
These societies do not need to lead to segregation.
A society does not need to be connected by land mass.
There is no reason why multiple societies cannot share
resources and economic communities or locations as long
as their principles do not conflict. As we currently have
different religions living in the same community, we can
have other different societies in the same community.
Societies which adopt principles in conflict with generally
held views would be shunned. Communal property such
as resources ought to belong to the entire user group and it
would be subject to it’s own rules of governance.
!
Each person could and would belong to many
different societies. They may belong to a family group, a
local economic group, an international economic group
and a religion. They may contribute to a community
garden, a global epistemic community, a local news
network and a football club. They may access a local
commons, an international network of local commons, and
the global commons. Their standing in each community is
unaffected by the other communities except where they
agree to form networks for economic or other purposes.!
This is actually exactly how we govern ourselves
now in most of our daily life. Every family group has its
own social contract, we all belong to community,
international and global user groups, and we all access the
local and global commons. This is a picture of society as it
exists in reality, without the arbitrary and unnecessary
state cages.
!
If we had governance by user group, and every user
group was open to anyone who agreed to community consensus,
there would be no purpose for states. Instead of being governed
in arbitrary boxes by land mass, we would be able to travel freely
among overlapping rings by function.!
Gun control laws in Arctic Canada dictated
through state democracy by people in Toronto, Montreal
and Vancouver, would be illogical and unfair. The concerns
of people in those cities would need to be considered
regarding any weapons that were brought within range of
causing harm to the people there, but communities would
decide local matters for themselves. Drilling for oil in the
Arctic is at the other end of the spectrum, and for one or a
group of nations or corporations to assert a ‘right’ to drill
for oil in the Arctic, dump iron fertilizer and radioactive
material into the Pacific or oil and dispersants into the
Atlantic is a violation of the rights of the global commons.
Oceans do not even belong to one generation much less
one species, one state or one corporation.
!
In environmentally sensitive areas such as the
Arctic, the few who live in the area must have their rights
considered along with the rights of the planet. A balance
needs to be struck between the needs of the local
population, who may, for instance, require (or choose) a
seal hunt to ensure the fish population or seal products
they need to survive, and the rights of the planet which is
not particularly affected by it. The opinion of the people in
the rest of the world who may be revolted by the seal hunt
must not be allowed to override the needs or wishes of
those who live there unless they can prove actual longterm
negative impact to the environment. The solution for those
revolted would be found in trade relationships they may
choose to terminate or communication to present their
position.
!
Each local user group or individual should have
access to outside user groups for trade, shared knowledge,
disaster relief, etc., autonomous but networked into a
larger society for mutual support.Global commons
!
Anything which is not only of global interest but
also does not belong to any one generation cannot
legitimately be claimed as the property of any individual,
group, corporation or government. Global commons
would include space, the atmosphere and electromagnetic
field, deep sea ocean, land and water masses of sufficient
size to have global impact, areas of the biosphere which
are rare or important enough to be of global concern, and
knowledge. Knowledge includes discoveries, history,
creative works, and the information people require in
order to govern themselves and excludes personal
information regarding individuals. If society is to progress,
there should be no restriction on the use of ideas.
!
Anything belonging to the global commons should
be held under stewardship of a permeable and transparent
organization set up for the purpose and under the scrutiny
of all. The mandate for all global commons must include
the protection and preservation of the commons. The
Public Trust Doctrine by Emperor Justinius declared in 529
A.D. “By the laws of nature, these things are common to all
mankind: the air, running water, the sea and consequently the
shores of the sea.” 58 England’s Charter of the Forest 59 is the
foundation for many rights documents in the English
speaking world. It demanded protection of a commons for
fuel, food and construction of shelter, all that was essential
for life. This type of commons is set up to preserve the
means for every person to attain their basic human rights
of shelter and food. This idea of a global commons has
been reinforced many times in many cultures and was
considered self evident in earlier history.
58 Institutes of Justinian,
529 A.D.
59 Charter of the Forest, 1217!
Some people are now taking the idea of a global
commons further to include the rights of the environment
as separate and above its use to humans. The integrity of
the earth, water and all species is considered not just as a
source of human needs but as having inherent rights of its
own. The 2008 Constitution of Ecuador with its Rights of
Nature and Bolivia’s 2010 Law of the Rights of Mother
Earth are two recent attempts to codify those rights. Like
individual rights, the needs of the global commons must
take precedence over all user groups.

Corporations have now claimed the right to
destroy environments above the political authority of
regional governance. This has been seen repeatedly as
resource corporations sue in international courts for their
‘right’ to destroy environments and livelihoods against the
wishes of communities. People are held accountable for
contracts, treaties and laws that representative governance
has enabled far above their heads. Security contractors are
hired to violently enforce these supposedly binding
contracts the people were not party to. States and
multinational bodies have taken so-called representative
governance to mean ownership of the basic rights of the
people. Corporations as superhuman embodiments of their
usually foreign based owners could not possibly be said to
have a legitimate interest in the resources of a community.
!
Because of the arbitrary political division into
states, governments of the world have been allowed to act
as though they were not responsible for the results of their
actions felt outside their own borders. The reality of a
global commons where the actions of one depletes the
opportunity of others is illustrated in the climate debts
from the global north to the global south. Both the damage
to their environments and the loss of their fair share of the
atmospheric space they now cannot use if climate change
is to be stopped are debts the south logically claim against
the north.Intangible property

Education must be free to allow everyone to
achieve their full potential. Right now education is seen as
part of a competitive society where more educated people
are competition for scarce jobs. Once family secrets were
used to ensure economic advantage. Old family recipes
and other domestic skills made women more marketable
as wives in the same manner that possession of trade
secrets made men in trade more marketable. These trade
secrets are no longer necessary on a personal basis and are
now used by corporations. In a stigmergical workplace
and an approval based economy, the success of one does
not deplete the success of another. If all individuals are at
liberty to achieve their full potential, society will be far
richer for their contributions.
!
The lack of free knowledge is crippling progress.
Because no one can build on ideas that work and all must
start from a different point, we lose a great deal of
innovation and research speed. In the case of diseases,
environmental health and other urgent crises, we cannot
afford the loss in time or the added expense and
inaccessibility brought by idea ownership.

While the scientific community theoretically
embraces open-source principles, in practice knowledge
production is done in private because of the competition to
produce papers and gain research funding. There is no
incentive to publish ideas and half researched papers that
one has no time or inclination to finish. Ideas are not
released for the research to be crowd sourced by other
scientists. The system is driven by competition. The
reputation system in science discourages real collaboration
in an idea based system in favour of a politically driven
personality based system.!
Copyrights and patents are economic tools which
frequently do not reward the idea originator and need to
be replaced with something that does. Free information
activists say information needs to be free and the
originator can be rewarded by looking for other avenues of
profit, such as public speaking. The idea that a scientist or
other expert should waste their time traveling around
appearing on panels and talk shows instead of following
their passion and ability is illogical and counter-
productive. By the time the general public has heard of a
published work most creative people have moved on to
the next project, or would like to. If an expert wishes to
speak, by all means, but if they do not they should still be
able to work quietly and rely on the community to ensure
they are credited and compensated. If celebrity is the path
to recognition and financial reward then it is celebrity they
will be seeking. Those spending time on actual research
will have their ideas attributed to those building a
following on Twitter and public speaking skills. Everyone
has been conditioned to expect aggressive advertising
from a creator, but better results could be obtained if the
user group recognized product promotion as their
responsibility and power.

Old corporate news media have nearly been
humiliated out of their Breaking! Exclusive! Scoop!
mentality with the news as they face a social media swarm
that gets everything long before or at least at the exact
same time that they do. The same change needs to happen
with innovation and research where those who hoard
research lose to those who drop their ideas instantly and
ask for crowd help. Reputation needs to come from visible
open collaboration between scientists instead of secrecy
and copyrighted publications. It is the responsibility of the
user group, if they want innovators to concentrate on
innovation and creators to concentrate on creating, to
ensure that credit goes to the person researching, notnecessarily the person seeking interviews. Research
funding needs to be allocated in support of actions and
ideas, and available to whoever accomplishes each task. In
that way scientists can work on what they please without
spending a huge amount of their time building up their
personal brands and begging for funding.
