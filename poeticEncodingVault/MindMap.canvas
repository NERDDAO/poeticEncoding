Let's integrate the context provided into this framework:\n\n1. **Information Density in Poetry:**\n   - **Shannon’s Unexpectedness:** Information density in a text can be gauged by the unexpectedness or entropy of its symbols. Poetry, due to its economical use of language and innovative diction, inherently has a higher information density as compared to prose.\n   - **Examples:** Classical and modern literary theories both suggest poetry's unique structure and word choice (such as using uncommon phrases or creating a defamiliarization effect) contribute to its high entropy.\n\n2. **Embedding Data:**\n    - **Dimensionality Reduction and Autoencoders:** Modernist works and poetry can be seen as datasets that have undergone dimensionality reduction.

By examining poetry's inherent structures and paradoxes, we aim to demonstrate how poetic forms can encode meaning with high efficiency. Utilizing concepts such as Shannon's measure of unexpectedness, Kolmogorov complexity, and the theory of defamiliarization, we discuss the potential improvements in data embeddings for natural language processing (NLP).\n\n#### Introduction\nThe convergence of poetry and information theory presents a unique opportunity to enhance the quality of data embeddings used in NLP. Poetry’s compact and dense use of language provides a rich ground for testing and improving the way semantic meaning is encoded in embeddings. This paper examines whether the structural and semantic properties of poetry can be harnessed to improve embeddings’ information density and coherence.\n\n#### Poetry from an Information Theory Perspective\nInformation theory, a mathematical framework for quantifying information, provides tools to analyze the density and unexpectedness in textual data. Poetry's high entropy due to its creative use of language makes it a compelling subject for this analysis. Specifically, we use Shannon's measure of unexpectedness to evaluate poetry's potential for improving embeddings.\n\n#### Information Density and Poetic Encoding\nPoetic language often defies conventional constraints, creating dense and layered meanings. This section explores how poetic encoding, through its concentrated use of words and structures, can increase the information density of data embeddings. We analyze examples of haikus and sonnets to illustrate this concept.\n\n#### Coherence and Knowledge Topology\nWhile poetry often employs defamiliarization and lack of synonymity, maintaining coherence is critical for meaningful interpretations. This section discusses how poetic structures influence the topology of knowledge graphs, ensuring that embedded representations maintain coherence while maximizing information density.\n\n#### Context vs No Context\nThe role of context in interpreting poetry is complex. We compare the impact of using poetic texts with and without contextual information on the performance of embeddings, examining how context affects their generalizability and robustness.\n\n#### Poetic Paradoxes\n**The Form Paradox**: Formal constraints in poetry, such as meter and rhyme, initially appear to limit expressive capacity. However, these constraints can lead to increased creativity and information density. We discuss how embedding models can benefit from training on such structured data.\n\n**The Nonsense Paradox**: While entropy is higher in random sequences, they lack semantic content. Poetry, though similar in complexity to random text, retains meaningful structures, offering a middle ground. We explore how embeddings can capture this balance.\n\n#### Shannon's Measure of Unexpectedness\nUnexpected word combinations in poetry can train models to recognize subtler distinctions in language. We evaluate how Shannon's measure can quantify the effectiveness of embeddings trained on poetic texts.\n\n#### Theory of Defamiliarization\nDefamiliarization in poetry, making familiar concepts appear new and strange, challenges traditional language models. This section examines how embeddings can be enhanced by incorporating texts that employ defamiliarization techniques.\n\n#### Lack of Synonymity\nPoetry often minimizes synonymity to maximize impact. We explore how reducing synonymity in training data affects the embeddings' ability to capture nuanced meanings and diverse contexts.\n\n#### Kolmogorov Complexity\nKolmogorov complexity measures the complexity of a text by the length of its shortest possible description. Poetry, with its condensed and rich nature, has high Kolmogorov complexity. We discuss how this metric can be used to evaluate and improve data embeddings.\n\n#### Conclusion\nBy incorporating poetic structures and principles from information theory, we propose that embeddings can achieve greater information density and better semantic representations. Future research should focus on integrating these findings into the development of more sophisticated and nuanced NLP models.\n\n#### References\n(Include a list of academic references and sources cited in the paper.)\n\n---\n\n### End of Draft Paper\n\nThis draft introduces a framework for leveraging poetry and information theory to enhance data embeddings, outlining key concepts and their applications in NLP.","x":2010,"y":3200,"width":870,"height":1836,"color":"6"},

By leveraging the high entropy and semantic richness inherent in poetry, we propose that embedding models can achieve more nuanced and expressive representations. This integration could significantly enhance various NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\n\n#### Introduction\n\nEmbedding data involves converting textual information into numerical vectors, capturing linguistic and semantic nuances. Traditional texts, though informative, often lack the complexity and density found in poetry. By contrasting the structured form and unexpected elements of poetry with standard prose, we aim to demonstrate how poetic constructs can enrich embedding representations.\n\n#### Methodology\n\n1. **Selection of Poetic Texts**: Curate a diverse corpus of poetry, ensuring a variety of styles, periods, and authors to maximize linguistic diversity and entropy.\n   \n2. **Embedding Techniques**: Utilize advanced embedding models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, and GPT to train on both standard and poetic texts. Compare the resulting embeddings for complexity and information density.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the embeddings based on their performance in downstream NLP tasks. Metrics to consider include accuracy, coherence, and ability to handle syntactic and semantic variability.\n\n#### Poetic Constructs and Information Theory\n\n1. **High Entropy in Poetry**: Poetry's creative language use and unconventional syntax increase entropy, providing a richer information source for embedding models.\n\n2. **Form Paradox**: Despite strict structural constraints (e.g., meter, rhyme), poetry manages to convey profound meaning and emotion, enhancing semantic density without syntactic complexity.\n\n3. **Embedding Representations**: Models trained on high-entropy poetic data can learn more intricate and flexible language patterns, potentially outperforming those trained on standard texts.\n\n#### Applications and Implications\n\n1. **Text Classification**: Improved embeddings can better capture subtle differences in text, leading to more accurate classifications.\n\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Poetic constructs can help models understand and interpret complex emotional cues.\n\n3. **Machine Translation**: Enhanced embeddings facilitate more accurate and contextually appropriate translations, especially for languages with rich poetic traditions.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIntegrating the high information density and semantic richness of poetry into embedding models offers a promising approach to advancing NLP capabilities. By leveraging poetic constructs, we can create more nuanced and expressive representations, ultimately enhancing the performance and applicability of NLP systems.\n\n#### Future Work\n\nFuture research could expand the corpus to include a broader range of poetic forms and explore the impact of specific poetic techniques on embedding quality.

In essence, the amount of information in a sequence is a function of its unpredictability. A sequence in which every element (symbol) can be predicted with certainty carries no information. Conversely, the more unexpected each element is, the higher the entropy and therefore the higher the information density. This principle can be directly applied to the study of literature, and particularly poetry, where language is often purposefully dense and layered.\n\nShannon himself experimented on the predictability of text by having participants guess the next letter in a sequence of symbols from randomly selected excerpts. The results highlighted significant differences in the information density between various kinds of text. Later studies, such as those by Fónagy (1961), compared the guess rates of characters in poetry, newspaper articles, and casual conversation, finding substantially higher entropy in poetry. Specifically, poetry exhibited a guess rate of only 40%, compared to 67% in newspapers and 71% in conversations.\n\nThis elevated unpredictability in poetry can be attributed to its defamiliarization techniques—unusual word choices, syntactic deviations, and unique phonic patterns—all of which contribute to its high information density. The unexpected elements not only enrich the semantic content but also engage the reader's cognitive faculties more intensely, achieving a poetic \"economy of language\" that traditional prose often does not.\n\nShannon's framework thus provides a quantifiable method to analyze the information density of poetic texts, bridging the gap between intuitive notions of literary richness and empirical measurement. By treating each word as a symbol and evaluating the probabilities of their occurrences within a text, we can objectively measure and compare the information content across different forms of writing.","x":2280,"y":297,"width":640,"height":798,"color":"6"},
		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"c1865cfcfafc89b7","type":"text","text":"### The Form Paradox\n\nFónagy (1961) observed that the rhythmical and phonetic constraints of poetry should theoretically reduce unpredictability and entropy, contradicting his experimental results. Abernathy (1961) similarly remarked, stating that \"poetry uses a considerably circumscribed and impoverished language compared to everyday speech.\" He suggested resolving this paradox by ascribing lower subjective probabilities to poems, implying higher unpredictability despite the limited language. However, this approach is nonconstructive as it lacks a clear method for assigning probabilities to texts and does not explain why these formal restrictions would ideally result in lower probabilities.\n\nA more detailed analysis comes from A.N. Kolmogorov, who approached this paradox by considering the set of all possible texts, and a particular poem as a member of this set, as popularized by Lotman (1977). Kolmogorov theorized that a poet selects or finds a text that conveys the desired meaning while satisfying formal constraints. For instance, if we consider all character sequences up to the length of \"War and Peace,\" a small subset would be grammatically correct and meaningful texts. Within this model, each sequence either has no meaning or exactly one, and different meanings can be distinguished.\n\nKolmogorov proposed subdividing texts into equivalence classes by synonymy. Each class contains texts that express the same meaning in different ways. For example, the class of texts expressing the meaning of \"Eugene Onegin\" would be large enough to include a text composed in Onegin stanzas. In this context, the logarithm of the number of synonymy classes represents the content capacity entropy (h1), and the average number of ways to express a given meaning represents the flexibility entropy (h2).\n\nFormal constraints in poetry reduce the pool of admissible texts, characterized by a negative entropy (β). Kolmogorov proposed that poetry is possible only when β < h2, suggesting that languages with sufficient flexibility can accommodate poetic forms despite their restrictive rules. However, the notion that a subset of literary texts forms part of the corpus of meaningful texts introduces complexity. The admissibility of texts, especially in poetry, is somewhat fuzzy since what is barely acceptable in prose may be perfectly acceptable in poetry.\n\nKolmogorov's later work on algorithmic complexity theory suggests this paradoxical view led him to explore more robust definitions of text complexity. His idea that the complexity of a text like \"War and Peace\" can be uniquely defined aligns with this progression. Uspensky's preface to Kolmogorov’s notes introduces the idea that some poetic lines, though nonsensical, fit within this expanded corpus.\n\nMetaphor and metonymy in poetry often violate standard semantic norms to create new meanings, as seen in phrases like \"the curtain of the night fell upon us\" or \"Juliet is the sun.\" Such tropes expand the space of admissible texts semantically. Syntactic violations, driven by poetic demands, further illustrate this flexibility. For example, Gerard Manley Hopkins emphasized themes by altering standard word order, as in \"Mortal my mate...\" instead of \"My mortal mate,\" exemplifying how syntax can be manipulated for poetic emphasis.\n\nIn summary, while poetic form narrows the pool of admissible texts statistically, various poetic devices counteract by expanding it. These devices push the boundaries of standard language syntax and semantics, preventing the language of poetry from becoming \"considerably circumscribed and impoverished\" and maintaining or even increasing its entropy.","x":2980,"y":215,"width":700,"height":1435,"color":"6"},

Shannonian entropy measures the unpredictability of text, while Kolmogorov complexity offers a view of text as a compressed program that evokes specific mental states in the reader.\n\nRelating this to the current research question about whether poetry can improve the information density of embedding data, we can infer the following:\n\n1. **Shannonian Entropy**: Poetry’s heightened unpredictability (higher entropy) due to its use of unique linguistic constructs suggests that it has a higher information density than ordinary text. This aligns with the hypothesis that poetry can enhance the effectiveness of data embedding by increasing the amount of information transmitted per unit length.\n\n2. **Kolmogorov Complexity**: Since poetry is seen as a highly compressed linguistic form that distills complex meanings and emotions into a compact form, it could efficiently encode data. If embedding data within a poetic structure, the inherent complexity and density of poetry can potentially allow for more efficient and subtle data embedding techniques, leveraging its compactness and richness of expression.\n\nThus, applying information-theoretic concepts to poetry suggests that its structured yet dense form could indeed enhance the information density of embedded data, making poetry a potentially effective medium for such tasks.","x":2000,"y":1497,"width":800,"height":617,"color":"6"},

Kolmogorov complexity, roughly defined as the length of the shortest program that generates a given text, offers another intriguing perspective. As Manin and Manin (2017) suggest, natural language can be viewed not only as a carrier of information but also as a program that operates within the brain of the receiver, aiming to induce a specific cognitive or emotional state.\n\nThis perspective is especially pertinent to poetry, whose primary goal often transcends the mere conveyance of information and targets the evocation of emotion and profound contemplation. It is often stated that powerful poetry compresses its language such that to fully encapsulate its meaning, one might need to elaborate extensively in prose. Hence, it could be argued that a great poem represents a maximally Kolmogorov-compressed form of the intended mental state.\n\nGiven that Kolmogorov complexity is non-computable, determining the most compressed description of anything—be it a mental state, an image, or a situation described in a poem—cannot be algorithmically achieved in an efficient manner. This underscores the inherently creative aspect of poetry, as crafting such compressed representations is a task beyond algorithmic calculation.\n\nRecent work by Grietzer (2017a, 2017b) delves into a related domain utilizing a vivid and concrete methodology. Grietzer employs autoencoders, a class of machine-learning algorithms founded on neural network architecture. These autoencoders are trained on large corpora to learn transformations that map input spaces to low-dimensional representation spaces, thereby embodying compression algorithms. Although generally lossy, this compression retains an invariant manifold—a set of points that can be compressed and reconstructed without loss.\n\nEvery human being naturally forms an internal low-dimensional representation of the world. Important features, both universal and unique, are encapsulated within this representation. Essentially, each individual functions as an autoencoder. When one aims to share a unique perspective with others, the optimal approach is to publish their invariant manifold, allowing others to train on it. This process describes the creation and consumption of art and literature.\n\nThis analogy intriguingly circumvents the non-computability issue associated with Kolmogorov complexity. Instead of seeking the shortest description of a predefined world fragment, an author starts with an existing short description and constructs a corresponding world fragment. While this breaks down somewhat given art's symbolic nature, the paradigm remains robust and promising for further exploration.","x":2198,"y":417,"width":602,"height":1112,"color":"6"},

Quoting Manin and\nManin (2017) (see also Manin, 2003): A natural language message is usually treated as carrying information. But it also can be treated as a program that runs in the brain of the receiver and whose purpose is to create a certain mind state in it. This interpretation is particularly interesting for literary texts, especially poetry, because their purpose is not conveying information, but rather imparting an emotional state to the reader. It is customary to state that successful poetry compresses its language and, consequently, if one wants to fully explicate the “meaning” of a good poem, an extensive prose text has to be written. So perhaps the right way to conceptualize a great poem is to say that it represents a maximally Kolmogorov-compressed representation of the target mind state.  Note that because Kolmogorov complexity is not computable, finding the maximally compressed description of something – whether a target mind state or an image, a scene, and a situation being described in the poem – is necessarily a creative act, something that can’t be done with an algorithm (faster than brute-force enumeration). Although this idea seems quite speculative, a recent work by Grietzer (2017a,b) explores a closely related territory in a spectacularly concrete fashion. Grietzer’s main instrument is autoencoders, a class of machine-learning algorithms based on the neural network architecture. An autoencoder is “trained” on a large corpus of objects from a multidimensional feature space and “learns” a transformation that maps this input space into a low-dimensional representation space. In other words, a trained autoencoder embodies a compression algorithm. This algorithm is\nreversible, so that any point in the representation space can be mapped back into the\ninput space, but it is also, generally speaking, lossy, i.e., the reverse mapping will\nnot necessarily reconstruct the original object exactly.\n\nHowever, there is an important low-dimensional submanifold in the input space,\nnamely, the set of its points the trained neural net learned to project into. We can\ncall it the invariant manifold, because the objects belonging to it are compressed\nby the autoencoder losslessly and can be reconstructed from their representations\nexactly. A crucial property of the invariant manifold is that the best way to recreate\nthe same mapping in another autoencoder is to train it on the first autoencoder’s\ninvariant manifold. (Of course, when dealing with computer software, it’s easier to\njust copy the trained state to another instance, but that only works for instances with\nidentical architecture.)  This is where art and literature come in. Everyone perceives the world by constructing an internal lower-dimensional representation of it. Only the most\nimportant features of the objects and events are represented there. Some important\nfeatures are more or less shared by all people; others are defined by one’s unique\nperspective and personality. So every human essentially embodies an autoencoder.\nSuppose one wants to share one’s unique perspective on the world (or, rather, a\nfragment of it) with others. The best way to do it is to publish one’s invariant\nmanifold (or, rather, a consistent piece of it) and let others train themselves on it.\nThis describes creating artwork and reading/viewing/listening to it.  Interestingly, this description seems to circumvent the non-computability prob-lem of Kolmogorov complexity, because instead of trying to find the shortest description of a predefined fragment of the world, the author takes an existing short description and constructs a fragment of the world best described by it. But of course, the analogy is somewhat broken at this point, because a work of art is not (usually) a literal fragment of the world, but a symbolic representation of it. Nevertheless, this looks like a very powerful paradigm with a great promise.","x":-317,"y":-516,"width":325,"height":247},

In  the same collection where that article was published, we find a short, but insightful, article by Abernathy (1961) where the same idea is put in this striking way: “poetry uses a considerably circumscribed and impoverished language compared to the everyday speech.” Abernathy proposed to resolve this paradox by ascribing a subjective probability to each message and postulating that poems are characterized by a drastically lower probability, i.e., higher unexpectedness, despite the fact\nthat they use “a considerably circumscribed” language. Unfortunately, this is a\nrather nonconstructive approach, since it is not clear how to ascribe probabilities\nto texts, and, more importantly, why or whether lower probability would result from\nsatisfying formal restrictions.\n\nA much more detailed exploration of this paradox is due to A.N. Kolmogorov, a\ngreat mathematician with a deep interest in literature. In a series of unpublished (at\nthe time) works popularized by Lotman (1977) (see also Kolmogorov, 1997; Yaglom\nand Yaglom, 1983), he was developing a formalized approach based on considering\na set of all possible texts and a particular poem as a member of this set. A poet can\nbe seen as selecting or finding the text that expresses the desired meaning and at the\nsame time satisfies some formal constraints.  As an illustration, consider the set of all character sequences, say, no longer than War and Peace. It is a very large, but finite, number. There would be in this set a small subset of grammatically correct and meaningful Russian texts. In this highly idealized model, we don’t care what exactly the “meaning” is, but we postulate that each character sequence has either no meaning or exactly one, and that given any two “meanings” we can always say whether they are the same or different. Subdivide all texts into equivalence classes by synonymy, so that each class contains texts that all mean the same. In other words, each class would express in all possible ways\nsome content different from that of the other classes. Consider the synonymy class\nin which all texts express the meaning of, say, Eugene Onegin. If this class is large\nenough, one can find in it a text that is composed in Onegin stanzas, which is what\na poet does. Then the number of synonymy classes would be equal to the number of meanings expressible with texts no longer than War and Peace, and the average number of\ntexts in each class is essentially the number of different ways to express any given\nmeaning. According to Kolmogorov, the former quantity (or rather, its logarithm)\nreflects the “content capacity entropy” of the language (h1 ), while the latter one\nreflects its “flexibility entropy” (h2 ). If the flexibility entropy is large enough, i.e.,\nif the given content can be expressed in a large enough number of ways, one can expect to find among those ways some that also satisfy the formal restrictions of\nversification. Because formal constraints reduce the pool of admissible texts, they\ncan be characterized by a negative entropy (β), and Kolmogorov proposed that\nversification is only possible in languages where β < h2 . Of course, one can’t get rid of the feeling that something is wrong in this picture.  Cf. the uncharacteristically impressionistic passage in a classical text on probability and information (Yaglom and Yaglom, 1983, p. 214):\nHowever, in the compositions of many eminent poets the decrease in the information content of one text letter, related to the fulfilment of known formal rules, is apparently compensated for to a great extent by the enhanced radiance and unconventionality of language. Therefore, it can be well expected that here the redundancy of the language has the same order as that of a prose literary text.  I suppose Kolmogorov felt that way too, which is why he apparently never published his model. In fact, in an undated manuscript (Kolmogorov, 2002) first published by Uspensky (2002), he wrote: “Poetry admits somewhat freer use of word order unconventional in prose, which somewhat increases [the flexibility entropy].” This essentially means that the basic notion of the set of all admissible\ntexts is somewhat fuzzy: what is barely admissible in prose can be quite admissible\nin poetry. But if the statistical population is not well defined, probability and,\nhence, information are also ill-defined. One can even surmise that it was this train\nof thought that eventually led Kolmogorov to propose his algorithmic complexity\ntheory. There is a telling remark in his groundbreaking paper (Kolmogorov, 1968)\nafter the introduction of what is now known as Kolmogorov complexity: “such\nquantities as the ‘complexity’ of the text of ‘War and Peace’ can be assumed to\nbe defined with what amounts to uniqueness.”  Uspensky in his preface to the publication of Kolmogorov’s notes (Uspensky, 1997) also admits that “the very notion that the corpus of literary texts is only a subset of the corpus of meaningful texts” requires rethinking and gives an example of the famous nonsense line from a poem by the Russian modernist\npoet Kruchenykh, consisting of three meaningless monosyllabics “Dyr bul shchyl”\n(Perloff, 2017, p. 73). Note, however, that while Kolmogorov pointed out the\nrelaxation of syntactic norms in poetry, Uspensky’s example hints at the possible\nrelaxation of semantic norms. In fact, such relaxation is well-known to literary scholars. We are used to the notion of metaphor as a specific feature of poetry and literary prose, but most  metaphors are literally absurd phrases, inadmissible by the standard semantics of\nthe language, as one can see with any textbook example like “the curtain of the\nnight fell upon us” or “Juliet is the sun.” So it’s easy to see that metaphor (as well as\nmetonymy and other tropes) already serves to expand the space of admissible texts\nin the semantic dimension. \\\n\nAs for syntactic expansion, an obvious example is the word order violation often arising from the demands of poetic form. However, not all syntactic oddities arise for purely technical reasons. Many figures of speech known and meticulously catalogued at least since antiquity are particular ways to enhance expression by violating rules of syntax. Consider, for example, the opening of G.M. Hopkins’1006 D. Manin\npoem “To His Watch”: “Mortal my mate. . . ” (Hopkins and Blaisdell, 2013, p. 84).\nFrom the point of view of rhythm, the standard word order, “My mortal mate,”\nwouldn’t be any inferior, but Hopkins forcefully emphasizes mortality, the theme of\nthe poem, by shifting the word to the syntactically awkward initial position.\nTo summarize, it appears that although poetic form does narrow down the\nstatistical population of all admissible texts, various poetic devices counteract\nby expanding it and by pushing the boundaries of the standard language syntax\nand semantics. In this way, they keep the language of poetry from becoming\n“considerably circumscribed and impoverished” (Abernathy, 1961) and prevent entropy reduction\n","x":93,"y":-1110,"width":400,"height":306},

Each haiku consists of three lines with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5. Despite strict formal constraints, haikus manage to convey profound imagery and emotions, often focusing on nature or moments of personal reflection.\n\nThe constraints of the haiku form initially seem to limit the unpredictability and thus the information density of the poem. However, haikus exemplify how brevity can enhance meaning by focusing on subtle yet powerful expressions. The rigid structure forces poets to choose each word with utmost care, ensuring that every element contributes significantly to the overall impact. \n\nIn terms of information theory, the haiku's succinct nature compresses a wealth of meaning into a few syllables, thus increasing the semantic density of the text. The deliberate choice of words and the evocation of layered imagery and emotion adhere to the idea that poetry can be more information-rich per unit length compared to prose. Each haiku essentially creates its own compact language, rich in meaning and resonance despite the limited use of words.\n\nFurthermore, haikus often employ the technique of juxtaposition, placing two images or ideas in close proximity to one another. This not only adds to the aesthetic quality but also introduces additional layers of meaning and complexity, increasing the unpredictability and expanding the set of all admissible texts in the context of poetry. By breaking away from conventional syntax and semantics, haikus push the boundaries of language, demonstrating that even within strict formal constraints, poetry can achieve high information density.\n\nIn conclusion, haikus illustrate how the principles of information theory apply to poetry, reinforcing the notion that artistic constraints can actually enhance, rather than diminish, the expressive power of a literary work. Despite—or perhaps because of—their formal restrictions, haikus achieve a remarkable level of meaning and emotional depth, validating the paradoxical relationship between form and entropy in poetic compositions.","x":-1331,"y":2321,"width":580,"height":639,"color":"6"},

By considering measures such as Shannon's unexpectedness and Kolmogorov complexity, we argue that the structured yet dense nature of poetry can optimize data representation and enhance the expressive power of linguistic models. The study examines the implications of poetic encoding on knowledge topology and the coherence of information both with and without context, providing a novel approach to improving embedding techniques.\n\n---\n\n### Introduction\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) increasingly relies on embeddings—numerical vector representations of words or sentences—to capture and manipulate semantic information. Traditional embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and more recent transformer models like BERT and GPT, strive to represent the subtleties of human language. We propose that poetry, with its high information density and inherent structure, can offer valuable insights into improving these embeddings.\n\n### Poetry and Information Theory\n\nPoetry compresses a wealth of meaning into a minimal number of words using carefully chosen language and structural constraints. From an information theory perspective, this compression reflects high entropy, as introduced by Shannon's measure of unexpectedness, and an efficient encoding of complex ideas.\n\n### High Entropy and Information Density\n\n1. **Unexpected Elements and Entropy**: Poetry features unconventional syntax and semantics, increasing entropy and providing richer contexts. This higher information density challenges embedding models to capture subtler distinctions in language.\n2. **Self-defining Language**: By creating unique linguistic patterns, poetry pushes the boundaries of syntax and semantics. Models trained on such data might better capture the creative and novel uses of language.\n3. **Reduction of Textual Synonymy**: Poetry's precise and nuanced use of language can help embedding models differentiate subtle variations in meaning, improving tasks like text generation, translation, and sentiment analysis.\n\n### The Form Paradox\n\nDespite the strict formal constraints of poetic forms like haikus, sonnets, and villanelles, these structures often enhance the depth and resonance of the conveyed meaning. This Form Paradox suggests that such constraints can facilitate higher information density, compelling models to learn efficient and potent linguistic representations.\n\n### Theory of Defamiliarization and Lack of Synonymity\n\nThe theory of defamiliarization posits that poetry makes the familiar strange, thereby enhancing perception and understanding. This defamiliarization and the deliberate lack of synonymity in poetry can enrich embedding models by exposing them to a broader array of linguistic and semantic contexts.\n\n### Application in Embeddings\n\n1. **Enhanced Embedding Representations**: Training modern embedding techniques on high-entropy texts like poetry can help models capture richer, more nuanced word representations.\n2. **Improved Predictive Power**: Embeddings that incorporate the structured unpredictability of poetry might generalize better, enhancing performance across NLP tasks.\n3. **Applications**: Such enriched embeddings can benefit various applications, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation, by offering a more comprehensive understanding of language.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIntegrating poetic principles and high-entropy text into the training of embedding models presents a promising avenue for enhancing NLP capabilities. By leveraging the information density and structural discipline inherent in poetry, we aim to create embeddings that are not only more efficient but also more expressive and robust in handling the complexities of human language.\n\n---\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\nFuture research can further explore applying computational models to encode and decode poetry, measure the impact on different NLP tasks, and develop specialized algorithms that incorporate these insights for broader applications in artificial intelligence and digital humanities.","x":-300,"y":3440,"width":700,"height":1705,"color":"6"},

Traditional forms of text, such as prose, have been extensively used for training embedding models. However, the unique characteristics of poetry offer an untapped resource for enhancing information density in these embeddings. This paper explores how poetic structures, with their high entropy and creative language use, can contribute to the development of richer, more efficient embeddings.\n\n#### High Entropy in Poetry\n\nPoetry is known for its high entropy due to the use of unexpected word combinations, creative syntax, and layered meanings. Unlike prose, which prioritizes clarity and predictability, poetry often breaks conventional linguistic norms to evoke strong emotions and vivid imagery. This inherent unpredictability translates to higher information density. By introducing diverse and uncommon word relationships, poetry challenges models to capture more nuanced semantic associations.\n\n#### Embedding Techniques\n\nModern embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformer-based models like BERT and GPT, aim to encode textual data into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors encapsulate semantic similarities and contextual relationships between words. Training these models on poetic texts could extend their learning to encompass broader linguistic variations and richer semantic contexts.\n\n1. **Word2Vec and GloVe**: These methods create embeddings by analyzing word co-occurrence patterns in large text corpora. Incorporating poetry can introduce rare co-occurrences and metaphoric language, enhancing the model's ability to capture subtle semantic nuances.\n\n2. **Transformers (BERT, GPT)**: Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to consider contextual relationships. Poetry's dense and evocative language can help these models understand deeper contextual connections, improving their ability to generate and interpret complex text.\n\n#### Poetic Constraints and Semantic Compression\n\nDespite the formal constraints of poetry (e.g., meter, rhyme), the high information density remains. The Form Paradox suggests that structured constraints do not necessarily reduce information content but can actually enhance it by compelling poets to choose words with precision. Embedding models can learn to identify and preserve these dense information patterns, creating embeddings that are both compact and semantically rich.\n\n#### Applications and Implications\n\n1. **Text Classification**: Richer embeddings can improve the accuracy of text classification tasks by better capturing nuanced semantic information, leading to more refined categorization.\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding the emotional subtleties in poetry can enhance sentiment analysis models, allowing them to detect complex emotional cues more effectively.\n3. **Machine Translation**: Poetry’s unique language patterns can improve translation models, enabling them to handle idiomatic and metaphorical expressions with greater accuracy.\n4. **Creative AI**: Embeddings derived from poetic texts can enhance AI's ability to generate creative and coherent literary pieces, contributing to advancements in creative writing tools.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIntegrating the high entropy and distinctive semantic characteristics of poetry into embedding models can significantly enhance their information density and predictive power. By leveraging the rich, compact language of poetry, NLP models can achieve a more profound understanding of linguistic nuances, leading to improvements across various applications. This research paves the way for further exploration into the symbiotic relationship between poetic forms and computational linguistics.","x":571,"y":3200,"width":749,"height":1525,"color":"6"},

Deep Learning, Literature, and Aesthetic Meaning\n\nThe central proposition of my dissertation is, informally, ‘it’s possible to learn a way of seeing by examining a group of objects that this way of seeing sees the best.’\n\nI take my cue from how compression-based representation-learning neural nets (what AI researches would call ‘autoencoders’ in a broad sense, from RBMs to VAEs and two-way GANs) not only learn a low dimensional representation space, but also a projection from each point in input-space to some point in a low dimensional submanifold within the input space.*\n\n[*This geometrical description draws on the accepted practice of idealizing autoencoders with continuous input spaces and deterministic ‘pixel-independent’ decoders as non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms. While the core ideas of this talk do carry over to autoencoders with autoregressive decoders, and in part even to pure autoregressive models like GPT architectures, the account becomes more complex.]\n\nSpeaking in rough terms, a trained autoencoder’s translation of an input object to its low dimensional representation space — the process of extracting an abstract, quasi-conceptual representation of the object — corresponds to taking the orthogonal projection of the input to a low dimensional submanifold in input-space, then taking the coordinates of the projection in a chart for this submanifold. I argue that there is a useful sense in which a sample from a trained autoencoder’s manifold expresses the autoencoder, and that studying this computational phenomenon gives us a fruitful formal model for thinking about a work of art as the expression of a way of seeing or a worldview.\n\nTo get the analogy going, let’s consider four properties that hold for the set of points composing the manifold of a (non-degenerate) trained autoencoder:\n\nIt’s the set of all the inputs that the trained net can compressedly encode with zero loss.*\nAll input reconstructions by the trained net will replace the original input with an element of this set.\nThe objects in this set collectively exemplify a specific high-fidelity simplification of the objects generated by the distribution underlying the training data.\nA neural net trained on this set as its input distribution will very quickly approximate the neural net that generated the set.**\n[*The idea that aesthetic artifacts may be unusually compressible goes back to Andrey Kolmogorov and more recently Jürgen Schmidhuber.]\n\n[**Property 4 constitutes an ‘original,’ though elementary, mathematical observation formulated in collaboration with mathematician Tomer Schlank. More precisely, we show that the sample efficiency of the output set is significantly higher than the sample efficiency of the training set.]\n\nSpeaking informally, the above properties almost explicitly describe art as we know it: an individual apprehends the world in a particular lossy way that is partly adapted to her formative environment, she produces a mimesis (i.e. interpretive reproduction) of the world that’s simpler than the world in a specific way that bears the mark of her particular lossy apprehension of the world, and other individuals can learn her apprehension of the world by trying to very exactingly apprehend the artefactual world she produced.* I argue that this similarity is not an accident or even an analogy, and properties 1–4 plausibly give something close to a functional definition of an ‘aesthetic symbol:’ a concrete, sensate representation of an abstract worldview. Additionally, properties 1–2 taken together give a near-equivalence between producing a mimesis of the world and curating a selection of minimum-loss objects from the world, as two ways to construct an approximate sample from the image of a net’s projection function. This near-equivalence suggest a way to understand curation, installation, collage, and other Modernist practices that are not immediately mimetic as, nevertheless, concrete sensate representations of a worldview.","x":-867,"y":-2680,"width":422,"height":231},

		{"id":"99b4821fef42cecb","type":"text","text":"## Introduction\nFrom the very beginning of information theory, researchers were tempted to apply\nit, even if informally or metaphorically, to literary texts, especially poetry. In his\ngroundbreaking paper, Claude Shannon (1948) wrote: Two extremes of redundancy in English prose are represented by Basic English [Wikipedia (2018) – DM] and by James Joyce’s book “Finigan’s Wake” [sic – DM]. The Basic English vocabulary is limited to 850 words and the redundancy is very high. This is reflected in the expansion that occurs when a passage is translated into Basic English. Joyce on the other hand enlarges the vocabulary and is alleged to achieve a compression of semantic content. Poetry is commonly described in terms of “economy of language,” “compression of meaning,” and so on. This notion even occurs in dictionary definitions, such as this one from the Merriam-Webster’s dictionary: “writing that formulates a concentrated imaginative awareness of experience in language” (Merriam-Webster online, 2018). So it seems that information theory must be able to contribute something to this intuitive notion that a work of literature can pack a lot of punch\nin a short stretch of text. Indeed, the theory defines a measure of content, and if one\ncould demonstrate that poetry has more content per unit length (information density\nor entropy) than nonliterary, utilitarian language, then that would be a proof of its\nelevated expressive power. Shannon’s definition of information operationalized some of the intuitive notions that had been expressed long before. Without getting into technical subtleties, the amount of information in a sequence of symbols is a measure of its unexpectedness.  The amount of information per symbol (entropy or information density) \nwhere pi is the probability for the ith symbol to occur. If every symbol can be  predicted with certainty, the sequence has no information in it, in agreement with the intuitive notion. The way to increase the amount of information is to compose the message out of unexpected elements. For example, if we consider each word in the text as a “symbol,” the greater the vocabulary, the smaller these probabilities are on average, so the amount of information increases. Compare this with how Aristotle in his Poetics recognized the importance of unexpected elements: “That diction [. . . ] is lofty and raised above the commonplace which employs unusual words.” and “It is precisely because such phrases are not part of the current idiom that they give distinction to the style” (Aristotle, 2008, Part\nXXII). As another reference point in modernity, consider Viktor Shklovsky’s theory of defamiliarization (ostranenie).\n\nA writer and scholar of the Russian formalism school, Shklovsky, contended that our perception is dulled by habituation, and the goal of literature is to refresh it by presenting things in an unfamiliar, estranged way, in particular with language (Shklovsky, 2015): The language of poetry is difficult, laborious language which puts the brakes on perception. In some particular cases, the language of poetry approaches the language of prose, but this does not violate the law of difficulty. [. . . ] For Pushkin’s contemporaries, Derzhavin’s elevated diction was the usual language of poetry, so that Pushkin’s style was unexpectedly difficult for them in its ordinariness. Recall that Pushkin’s contemporaries were horrified by his vulgar expressions. Pushkin used the vernacular as a device to arrest attention [. . . ] Shannon’s definition allows us to actually compute some measure of unexpect- edness of a text’s language: either by using word frequency as an approximation to its probability or by asking human subjects to predict the next word (or letter) and estimating probability from the success rate on this task. There have been some attempts to do that early on. Shannon himself conducted the first experiments (Shannon, 1951), where a respondent was asked to guess the next letter in randomly chosen fragments of a Jefferson biography. Shannon was mostly interested in estimating the information rate itself and didn’t study differences between texts. Later, a number of researchers repeated and elaborated Shannon’s experiments.  Fónagy (1961) compared guess rate of the next character in three different texts: a poem, a newspaper article, and a “conversation of two young girls.” Apparently, he\nused a simplified method, where each letter was guessed only once (in contrast to\nShannon’s guessing until the correct answer is obtained), which doesn’t provide a way to compute entropy estimates. But the guess rates of 40% in poetry, 67% in\nnewspaper, and as high as 71% in conversation suggested an elevated entropy for the poetry.\n\n\nOther estimates of the natural language entropy, both using Shannon-style experiments and statistical text analysis, can be found in Burton and Licklider (1955), Paisley (1966), Kolmogorov (1968), Cover and King (1978), Kontoyiannis (1996/1997), Pereira et al. (1996), Teahan and Cleary (1996), Moradi et al. (1998). In some of these works, attempts have been made to correlate information-\ntheoretical characteristics of texts with their style and literary quality. However, for the most part, such studies were motivated by practical applications like text\ncompression. The only systematic study of entropy as a function of style, period, and author that I am aware of is Paisley (1966). Though it employed a very crude\nentropy estimate (by frequencies of two-letter sequences), a systematic difference\nwas found between prose and poetry texts, the latter having higher entropy, i.e., information density, in agreement with expectations. \n\nHowever, if we attempt to naively apply information-theoretic concepts to poetry, two paradoxes immediately arise. First, the constraints of poetic form, such as meter,\nalliteration, and rhyme, restrict the pool of words that can fill a given place in the line and so should decrease unpredictability and entropy, rather than increase it. Call\nthis The Form Paradox. Second, according to Shannon’s theory, the highest entropy is found in a completely random character sequence, where all characters occur with equal frequency and independently of each other. But a random sequence of letters (or words) can’t form a meaningful text, so it’s not even clear in what sense it can be treated as containing information. Call this The Nonsense Paradox.","x":-2055,"y":-1319,"width":512,"height":534},
		{"id":"dde21b0de1a61736","type":"text","text":"Building upon these observations, I construct a mathematically informed interpretation of a classic literary-theoretic thesis: that a work of literature can effectively communicate an ineffably complex holistic understanding of the real world, which we might call the work’s ‘aesthetic meaning.’ While my discussion focuses on literature, these same considerations may also apply to works of art in other media, to the extent that one can (partially) interpret a given work of art as constructing or curating a specialized dataset.\n\nI begin by arguing that we should treat the content of a literary work as, in part, a set of data-points in a cognitive input-space. Why should this be the case? The kind of pattern-recognition practices typical of literary or aesthetic reading, I propose, consistently call on the reader to discretize the work’s content into intercomparable data-points in order to appreciate the play of difference, repetition, and variation that makes up a literary work’s narrative and rhetorical progression: to appreciate a literary work aesthetically is, in part, to compare and contrast the various situations, objects, actions, places, characters, tropes, concepts, and images that vary over the work’s narrative and rhetorical course. The concrete imaginative content of a literary work is therefore, in part, a pattern-rich sequence of data-points in the reader’s representation space. On the analysis that I propose, the reader’s representation space acts as the input-space in an unsupervised representation-learning process that the reader carries out by studying the work’s concrete imaginative content. For the purposes of the current thesis, we put sequencing aside* and focus on the set of intercomparable data-points associated with a given literary work.\n\n","x":-2979,"y":-2503,"width":601,"height":823},

		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"5382344f71c1248b","type":"text","text":"The current research question examines whether poetry can improve the information density of embedding data. The context provided can be related to the research question in the following ways:\n\n1. **Shannon’s Definition and Poetry**: Information density, or entropy, measures the amount of unpredictability in a sequence of symbols. Poetry often aims to communicate complex meanings with fewer, carefully chosen words. This aligns with Shannon’s idea that language with higher unpredictability (more unexpected elements) carries more information. Poems, with their refined language and innovative use of words, might, therefore, increase the entropy and information density of embedded data.\n\n2. **Aesthetic Meaning**: The notion of a work of literature transmitting an ineffably complex holistic understanding—its aesthetic meaning—parallels the idea that poetry uses refined patterns and sophisticated language to convey deeper meanings. If we consider embedding data as a means to encode complex information compactly, using poetry can potentially enhance this process by increasing data richness and meaningful associations.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition in Reading**: Reading poetry requires engaging in pattern recognition, comparing and contrasting themes, metaphors, and structures. In terms of embedding data, the structured use of poetic language can create rich, intercomparable data points, enhancing the density and quality of information embedded.\n\n4. **The Form Paradox and The Nonsense Paradox**: These paradoxes reveal the complexities of applying information theory to poetry. The Form Paradox suggests that poetic constraints might reduce unpredictability, yet high-quality poetry still manages to embed substantial meaning within these constraints, potentially increasing the meaningful information density. The Nonsense Paradox highlights that while random sequences have high entropy, they lack meaningful information. Quality poetry balances between unpredictability and meaningfulness, showing that high entropy can coexist with high information content, a useful property for embedding data.\n\n5. **Empirical Evidence**: Studies mentioned (e.g., Fónagy, Paisley) show that poetry tends to have higher entropy compared to prose, suggesting it packs more information per unit of text. Applying this to embeddings, poetry's high entropy can be harnessed to create more information-dense embeddings that efficiently capture nuanced meanings and associations.\n\nBy leveraging poetry’s intrinsic properties of high information density and complex meaning encoding, embedding data can potentially be improved to be more expressive and rich in information.","x":-2626,"y":-440,"width":706,"height":1049,"color":"6"},

		{"id":"aa0a9ba74137531d","type":"text","text":"The proposition that a work of art can model the manifold structure of a real-world distribution is particularly useful as key to Modernist aesthetic theory and practice, in as much as Modernism is associated with a focus on abstract, diffused, ineffable structures of meaning bound to a work’s overall aesthetic form rather than on the more direct fruits of a work’s narrative, rhetorical, and lyrical communication. Specifically, the concept of a trained autoencoder’s manifold provides a strong conceptual interface between three major critical approaches to Modernist works’ ‘abstract, diffused, ineffable’ structures of meanings. The three approaches that concern us are as follows:\n\nA) A cultural-Phenomenological approach to Modernist works as portraits of moods or ‘Stimmungen’ (subjects’ representation-spaces), nowadays very actively at play in literary studies. (cf. Sianne Ngai, Jonathan Flatley)\n\n[Simplified: a Modernist work aims to demonstrate a way of looking at the world.]\n\nB) A formalist-materialist approach to Modernist works as algorithms for the aggregation of textual or cultural materials that together form some weak field of coherence, central to the theory and practice of (speaking real loosely here) ‘conceptual writing.’ (cf. Tan Lin, Hugh Kenner)\n\n[Simplified: a Modernist work aims to demonstrate a weak affinity between the many heterogeneous worldly or textual materials it patches together.]\n\nC) The Symbolist approach to Modernist (Symbolist) texts as invocations of the ‘correspondences’ or ‘esoteric affinities’ that structure the perceptible surfaces of the world in accordance with ‘primordial Ideals’ that govern the ordinary world of visible phenomena. Associated with the early Modernist writers themselves more than literary studies. (cf. Charles Baudelaire, Gertrude Stein)\n\n[Simplified: a Modernist work aims to demonstrate an underlying structure in phenomena that seem unstructured.]\n\nOn my account, each of these paradigms identically identifies the ‘meaning’ of a Modernist work with a trained autoencoder’s manifold, describing one and the same formal structure via different functional definitions. (Elsewhere, in work geared to the literary theorist, I relate this multifunctionality to Raymond Williams’ appropriately tricky concept of ‘structures of feeling.’)\n\nThe integrated story of our three ‘Modernist paradigms,’ under the manifold interpretation, can be told roughly as follows. To begin, let us recall that in unsupervised representation learning, we take a large set of data and learn a set of features that allows us to compressedly represent each piece of data in the set with minimal loss. We can regard this set of features as a ‘mental language,’ in a certain strictly heuristic sense: a trained net’s low-dimensional representation is functionally comparable to sequences of qualified predicates — e.g. ‘somewhat p, not f, not q, barely t, very g…’ — such that the predicates stay constant from input to input but the qualifiers vary. To the extent that a deep dimensionality reduction is appropriate for some given dataset, the ‘vocabulary’ of the language must approximately track the factors of variation entangled in the data. The features, in other words, must more or less correspond to something like Plato’s objects whose ineffably interacting shadows on the cave’s wall are the data. At the same time, to the extent that a deep dimensionality reduction is appropriate for some dataset, the ‘semantics’ of the resulting ‘vocabulary’ is also likely to be highly non-modular, analytically intractable, and “situated.” With these considerations in mind, calling the features learned in deep dimensionality reduction ‘esoteric affinities of perceptible surfaces to primordial Ideals,’ as in C, requires little if any poetic license.\n\nLet us also recall, now, that the feature list extracted by unsupervised deep learning is equivalent to a coordinate system on a lower-dimensional manifold in the input space, such that given the feature list we can efficiently ask of new data whether it lies close to this manifold, and with certain further allowances even generate random new data that lies on this manifold. While points on this manifold are not necessarily similar to one another, they collectively have an affinity to one another: as objects generated from the same highly constrained generative ‘language,‘ they share at least of some minimal form of what we might tentatively call a ‘style’ or ‘vibe’ or ‘genre.’ Equivalently, any sufficiently large — relative to the learning algorithm’s complexity — set of datapoints covered by the manifold has an unusually low absolute Kolmogorov complexity (i.e. has high compressibility), a condition which most sciences regard as necessary, but only ambiguously sufficient, for possessing a “meaningful structure.” These structures of affinity are the kind of promising but in and of themselves ‘weak’ fields of coherence that we know from ‘B.’\n\nFinally, recall that once the training of an unsupervised deep learning algorithm is finished, when the algorithm encounters new input data it projects the data into the lower-dimensional manifold (within the input space) corresponding to the feature list. The algorithm ‘keeps’ only the aspects of the data that are captured by the feature list, then treats these feature values as coordinates on the manifold, and then picks the corresponding item on the manifold as the reconstruction of the input data. I propose that quite apart from any implication that a trained unsupervised deep learning algorithm is a good overall analogue for the mind of a human subject, we have good (if provisional) grounds to hold that the problem of locally linear dimensionality reduction is a staple of the “ecological niche” humans and learning algorithms for ‘AI domains’ share. If this is so, then we sometimes have reason to regard a person whose cognition is sensitive to some patterns in the world around her and insensitive to others— a person who excels at seeing certain similarities and differences but erases others — as projecting the worldly things she encounters into a lower-dimensional manifold spanned by her already-trained mental ‘language.’ On this account, we might treat the lower-dimensional manifold we’re learning when our minds are doing a dimensionality reduction on the data in e.g. a Modernist novel as a “reverse engineering” of the lower-dimensional manifold covered by the author’s or narrator’s ‘mental language’ (i.e. feature space). Or better yet, we might treat this manifold as the ‘mental language’ of a new way of seeing for which the novel’s aesthetic meaning is a blueprint. We have arrived, in any case, at one form or another of a Stimmung as in ‘A.’\n\nLet’s sum up. I propose that Modernist works are often in the business of teaching you the coordinates of a lower-dimensional manifold in the space of possible data. When we look at the three paradigms for thinking about the cognitive product of Modernist works, ‘C’ (’Ideals’) treats learning the manifold as learning the generative model of the data, ‘A’ (’Stimmung’) treats learning the manifold as learning the dimensionality reduction method that produced the data as ‘reconstructions’ of other data, and ‘B’ (’weak coherence’) treats learning the manifold as learning that a certain set is compressible. In other words, the same thin twisty slice in the input space can be interpreted as the expression of someone’s dimensionality reduction method (re: Stimmung), or as a set of objects that compress together well en masse (re: weak fields of coherence), or as a set of objects such that the difference between any object y and any object x is a principled difference (re: primordial Ideals).","x":-2080,"y":-734,"width":250,"height":207},

		{"id":"f513c055c53755a7","type":"text","text":"Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination\nbetween agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in\nthe environment by an action stimulates the performance of a\nnext action, by the same or a different agent.

It\nproduces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without\nneed for any planning, control, or even direct communication\nbetween the agents. – Wikipedia\n!\nCertain ideas are powerful enough to create a\nbutterfly effect, a swarm that will not be stopped by any\nrestraining force. The civil rights movement in the United\nStates was one such idea which no amount of opposition\ncould prevent. The power of stigmergy was proven in that\nand many other points in history. Stigmergy is the action\nbased twin of an idea based system.

Concentric user groups with epistemic\ncommunities and knowledge bridges may work for idea\nbased systems. For action, stigmergy seems the best\noption.\n!\nCurrently, the typical response to a situation which\nrequires an action is to create a noun, in the form of acommittee, commission, organization, corporation, NGO,\ngovernment body, etc. Far too often, the action never\nappears at all as the focus is always on the organization\nand the personalities involved instead.\n!\nMost systems are now run by competitive\norganizations. Competition creates redundancy, is slow\nand wastes resources on idea protection, advertisement,\nand more. Competition also requires secrecy which blocks\nprogress and auditing and causes lost opportunities and\nideas. Patents and copyrights further limit speed and the\npotential for mass input of ideas. Collaboration between\nthe people with the greatest expertise does not happen\nunless they are hired by the same project.\n!\nThe alternative to competition has traditionally\nbeen cooperation.

For groups larger than 25, cooperation\nis agonizingly slow, an exercise in personality management\nwhich quickly degenerates into endless discussion and\nsoothing of ruffled feathers, is extremely vulnerable to\nagent provocateurs, and in large scale groups very seldom\naccomplishes anything of value. Cooperation traditionally\noperates on the democratic principle that all voices are\nequal, so it does not allow for leaders, or users with greater\nexpertise, energy or understanding to have greater\ninfluence than those on the periphery. Cooperation wastes\na great deal of time and resources in both discussing and\ndiscussing the discussions. In an action based system, this\ndiscussion is rarely required as the opinion of those not\ndoing the work is probably of little value unless it is\nsolicited advice from a trusted knowledgeable party.","x":-2854,"y":-1306,"width":250,"height":60},

		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"a0b84fce2e11def3","type":"text","text":"### Draft: Using Haikus as a Normalization Device for Composable Knowledge Graphs\n\nIn the realm of information theory and data science, the concept of using haikus—a traditional form of Japanese poetry—as a normalization device for creating composable knowledge graphs presents a novel interdisciplinary approach. Below is a detailed exploration of how haikus can enhance the quality and coherence of knowledge graphs, ensuring higher information density and better integration.\n\n#### Poetry from an Information Theory Perspective\nHaikus, characterized by their minimalistic structure (5-7-5 syllable pattern), encapsulate complex ideas and emotions with high precision. From an information theory standpoint, this form achieves high information density by packing significant meaning into a compact format. Such a poetic encoding can serve as a valuable model for data compression and normalization in knowledge graphs.\n\n#### Information Density in Haikus\nThe process of crafting a haiku involves distilling a thought or image to its essence, ensuring that every word and syllable contributes to the overall meaning. This practice aligns with the principles of high information density and can be directly applied to knowledge graphs:\n- By representing concepts with the minimal necessary detail, we ensure that each node and edge in the graph carries maximum semantic weight.\n- Haikus enforce a disciplined use of language, which can inspire similar discipline in structuring and encoding data, leading to more efficient and meaningful knowledge representations.\n\n#### Poetic Encoding and Coherence\nHaikus' strict structural constraints and rich semantic layers provide a framework for encoding information more coherently. This encoding can be mirrored in knowledge graph construction by adhering to standardized semantic rules:\n- Each node (representing a concept) and edge (representing a relationship) must adhere to a predefined semantic schema, ensuring coherence and interoperability.\n- Using haiku-inspired constraints can eliminate redundancy and ambiguity—core concerns in the construction of composable knowledge graphs.\n\n#### Knowledge Topology and Context\nHaikus often juxtapose contrasting images or ideas, a technique that enriches the context and enhances the reader's understanding. In knowledge graphs:\n- Contextual richness is vital for accurately capturing relationships and dependencies between nodes.\n- Haiku-inspired encoding ensures that every node and link are contextually relevant, enhancing the overall topology of the knowledge graph.\n\n#### Addressing Poetic Paradoxes\nThe poetic paradoxes, such as the form paradox (strict structure vs. expressive freedom) and the nonsense paradox (apparent nonsense leading to deeper meaning), offer valuable lessons for knowledge graph normalization:\n- **The Form Paradox**: Just as haikus find freedom within constraints, knowledge graphs can achieve flexibility and richness within a structured schema.\n- **The Nonsense Paradox**: Ambiguities and unique expressions in poetry that force deeper exploration can inspire data normalization techniques that allow for unusual or unexpected relationships, yet maintain ultimate coherence.\n\n#### Shannon’s Measure of Unexpectedness\nApplying Claude Shannon’s measure of unexpectedness to haikus reveals techniques for maintaining high information value. Within knowledge graphs, this concept can:\n- Help identify and preserve the most unexpected, hence information-rich, relationships.\n- Ensure that data normalization processes maintain the integrity of complex, less obvious connections.\n\n#### Theory of Defamiliarization\nHaikus often utilize the theory of defamiliarization, presenting familiar objects in an unfamiliar way to deepen understanding. This can be directly applied to knowledge graphs:\n- Encouraging the representation of commonplace concepts in novel ways, thus uncovering deeper insights and enhancing information retrieval.\n\n#### Lack of Synonymity\nHaikus rarely use synonyms, choosing the most precise word for impact. This principle can guide the normalization of knowledge graphs:\n- Ensure that each node and relationship term is unique and contextually appropriate, minimizing semantic overlap and maximizing clarity.\n\n#### Kolmogorov Complexity\nHaikus strive for simplicity in expression while maintaining depth, akin to minimizing Kolmogorov complexity in information theory:\n- Knowledge graphs can similarly aim for simplicity in structure while preserving complex semantic relationships, ensuring ease of use and interpretability.\n\n### Conclusion\nApplying the principles of haikus as a normalization device for creating composable knowledge graphs merges the precision and depth of poetic encoding with the structured demands of knowledge representation. By leveraging the information density, coherence, and defamiliarization techniques inherent in haikus, we can enhance the utility, integration, and semantic richness of knowledge graphs, driving forward advancements in data science, artificial intelligence, and beyond.","x":4340,"y":3200,"width":820,"height":1981,"color":"6"},

Both disciplines emphasize minimalism and structure, aiming to convey complex ideas in a concise form. We investigate how principles from each can inspire and inform the other, proposing a framework for poetic encoding in knowledge graphs.\n\n#### Introduction\nHaikus are a traditional form of Japanese poetry known for their brevity and depth. Structured in three lines with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5, haikus capture profound moments in few words. Graph theory, on the other hand, represents relationships through nodes and edges, providing a visual and mathematical means of managing complex data relationships succinctly. Both forms share an underlying principle: less is more.\n\n#### Methodology\nWe analyze the structural and thematic elements of haikus and compare them with the principles of graph theory. By deconstructing haikus into their fundamental components and mapping these onto graph theory paradigms, we identify parallels and synergies.\n\n1. **Structural Minimalism**:\n    - Points of Interest in Haikus: Nodes\n    - Relationships and Juxtapositions: Edges\n\n2. **Emphasis on Unique Elements**:\n    - Unique Imagery and Phrases: Unique Nodes\n    - Avoidance of Redundancy: Removal of Synonyms\n\n3. **Kolmogorov Complexity**:\n    - Simplifying Expression: Minimizing Data Representation\n    - Conveying Rich Meaning: Maximizing Interpretative Depth\n\n#### Results\nBy applying graph theory to haikus, we construct knowledge graphs that retain the essence of the poems while highlighting interconnected ideas. These graphs demonstrate how minimalistic data points can convey comprehensive narratives. Conversely, haiku-inspired principles of conciseness and depth improve the efficiency and clarity of graphical data representations.\n\n#### Case Studies\nWe present several case studies where haikus were transformed into knowledge graphs, showing clear, poetic data representation. We also reverse the process, encoding complex graphs into haiku form without losing critical information.\n\n#### Discussion\nThe intersection of haiku and graph theory reveals mutual benefits:\n- **For Poetry**: Enhanced visual and structural understanding through graph representation.\n- **For Graph Theory**: Improved data efficiency and narrative richness inspired by poetic minimalism.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOur study highlights the value in cross-disciplinary approaches, showcasing how ancient poetic techniques can optimize modern data representation. Future work will explore automated tools for haiku-to-graph transformation and vice versa.\n\n#### References\n1. Kolmogorov, A.
