By examining poetry's inherent structures and paradoxes, we aim to demonstrate how poetic forms can encode meaning with high efficiency. Utilizing concepts such as Shannon's measure of unexpectedness, Kolmogorov complexity, and the theory of defamiliarization, we discuss the potential improvements in data embeddings for natural language processing (NLP).\n\n#### Introduction\nThe convergence of poetry and information theory presents a unique opportunity to enhance the quality of data embeddings used in NLP. Poetry’s compact and dense use of language provides a rich ground for testing and improving the way semantic meaning is encoded in embeddings. This paper examines whether the structural and semantic properties of poetry can be harnessed to improve embeddings’ information density and coherence.\n\n#### Poetry from an Information Theory Perspective\nInformation theory, a mathematical framework for quantifying information, provides tools to analyze the density and unexpectedness in textual data. Poetry's high entropy due to its creative use of language makes it a compelling subject for this analysis. Specifically, we use Shannon's measure of unexpectedness to evaluate poetry's potential for improving embeddings.\n\n#### Information Density and Poetic Encoding\nPoetic language often defies conventional constraints, creating dense and layered meanings. This section explores how poetic encoding, through its concentrated use of words and structures, can increase the information density of data embeddings. We analyze examples of haikus and sonnets to illustrate this concept.\n\n#### Coherence and Knowledge Topology\nWhile poetry often employs defamiliarization and lack of synonymity, maintaining coherence is critical for meaningful interpretations. This section discusses how poetic structures influence the topology of knowledge graphs, ensuring that embedded representations maintain coherence while maximizing information density.\n\n#### Context vs No Context\nThe role of context in interpreting poetry is complex. We compare the impact of using poetic texts with and without contextual information on the performance of embeddings, examining how context affects their generalizability and robustness.\n\n#### Poetic Paradoxes\n**The Form Paradox**: Formal constraints in poetry, such as meter and rhyme, initially appear to limit expressive capacity. However, these constraints can lead to increased creativity and information density. We discuss how embedding models can benefit from training on such structured data.\n\n**The Nonsense Paradox**: While entropy is higher in random sequences, they lack semantic content. Poetry, though similar in complexity to random text, retains meaningful structures, offering a middle ground. We explore how embeddings can capture this balance.\n\n#### Shannon's Measure of Unexpectedness\nUnexpected word combinations in poetry can train models to recognize subtler distinctions in language. We evaluate how Shannon's measure can quantify the effectiveness of embeddings trained on poetic texts.\n\n#### Theory of Defamiliarization\nDefamiliarization in poetry, making familiar concepts appear new and strange, challenges traditional language models. This section examines how embeddings can be enhanced by incorporating texts that employ defamiliarization techniques.\n\n#### Lack of Synonymity\nPoetry often minimizes synonymity to maximize impact. We explore how reducing synonymity in training data affects the embeddings' ability to capture nuanced meanings and diverse contexts.\n\n#### Kolmogorov Complexity\nKolmogorov complexity measures the complexity of a text by the length of its shortest possible description. Poetry, with its condensed and rich nature, has high Kolmogorov complexity. We discuss how this metric can be used to evaluate and improve data embeddings.\n\n#### Conclusion\nBy incorporating poetic structures and principles from information theory, we propose that embeddings can achieve greater information density and better semantic representations. Future research should focus on integrating these findings into the development of more sophisticated and nuanced NLP models.\n\n#### References\n(Include a list of academic references and sources cited in the paper.)\n\n---\n\n### End of Draft Paper\n\nThis draft introduces a framework for leveraging poetry and information theory to enhance data embeddings, outlining key concepts and their applications in NLP.","x":2010,"y":3200,"width":870,"height":1836,"color":"6"},

		{"id":"99b4821fef42cecb","type":"text","text":"## Introduction\nFrom the very beginning of information theory, researchers were tempted to apply\nit, even if informally or metaphorically, to literary texts, especially poetry. In his\ngroundbreaking paper, Claude Shannon (1948) wrote: Two extremes of redundancy in English prose are represented by Basic English [Wikipedia (2018) – DM] and by James Joyce’s book “Finigan’s Wake” [sic – DM]. The Basic English vocabulary is limited to 850 words and the redundancy is very high. This is reflected in the expansion that occurs when a passage is translated into Basic English. Joyce on the other hand enlarges the vocabulary and is alleged to achieve a compression of semantic content. Poetry is commonly described in terms of “economy of language,” “compression of meaning,” and so on. This notion even occurs in dictionary definitions, such as this one from the Merriam-Webster’s dictionary: “writing that formulates a concentrated imaginative awareness of experience in language” (Merriam-Webster online, 2018). So it seems that information theory must be able to contribute something to this intuitive notion that a work of literature can pack a lot of punch\nin a short stretch of text. Indeed, the theory defines a measure of content, and if one\ncould demonstrate that poetry has more content per unit length (information density\nor entropy) than nonliterary, utilitarian language, then that would be a proof of its\nelevated expressive power. Shannon’s definition of information operationalized some of the intuitive notions that had been expressed long before. Without getting into technical subtleties, the amount of information in a sequence of symbols is a measure of its unexpectedness.  The amount of information per symbol (entropy or information density) \nwhere pi is the probability for the ith symbol to occur. If every symbol can be  predicted with certainty, the sequence has no information in it, in agreement with the intuitive notion. The way to increase the amount of information is to compose the message out of unexpected elements. For example, if we consider each word in the text as a “symbol,” the greater the vocabulary, the smaller these probabilities are on average, so the amount of information increases. Compare this with how Aristotle in his Poetics recognized the importance of unexpected elements: “That diction [. . . ] is lofty and raised above the commonplace which employs unusual words.” and “It is precisely because such phrases are not part of the current idiom that they give distinction to the style” (Aristotle, 2008, Part\nXXII). As another reference point in modernity, consider Viktor Shklovsky’s theory of defamiliarization (ostranenie).\n\nA writer and scholar of the Russian formalism school, Shklovsky, contended that our perception is dulled by habituation, and the goal of literature is to refresh it by presenting things in an unfamiliar, estranged way, in particular with language (Shklovsky, 2015): The language of poetry is difficult, laborious language which puts the brakes on perception. In some particular cases, the language of poetry approaches the language of prose, but this does not violate the law of difficulty. [. . . ] For Pushkin’s contemporaries, Derzhavin’s elevated diction was the usual language of poetry, so that Pushkin’s style was unexpectedly difficult for them in its ordinariness. Recall that Pushkin’s contemporaries were horrified by his vulgar expressions. Pushkin used the vernacular as a device to arrest attention [. . . ] Shannon’s definition allows us to actually compute some measure of unexpect- edness of a text’s language: either by using word frequency as an approximation to its probability or by asking human subjects to predict the next word (or letter) and estimating probability from the success rate on this task. There have been some attempts to do that early on. Shannon himself conducted the first experiments (Shannon, 1951), where a respondent was asked to guess the next letter in randomly chosen fragments of a Jefferson biography. Shannon was mostly interested in estimating the information rate itself and didn’t study differences between texts. Later, a number of researchers repeated and elaborated Shannon’s experiments.  Fónagy (1961) compared guess rate of the next character in three different texts: a poem, a newspaper article, and a “conversation of two young girls.” Apparently, he\nused a simplified method, where each letter was guessed only once (in contrast to\nShannon’s guessing until the correct answer is obtained), which doesn’t provide a way to compute entropy estimates. But the guess rates of 40% in poetry, 67% in\nnewspaper, and as high as 71% in conversation suggested an elevated entropy for the poetry.\n\n\nOther estimates of the natural language entropy, both using Shannon-style experiments and statistical text analysis, can be found in Burton and Licklider (1955), Paisley (1966), Kolmogorov (1968), Cover and King (1978), Kontoyiannis (1996/1997), Pereira et al. (1996), Teahan and Cleary (1996), Moradi et al. (1998). In some of these works, attempts have been made to correlate information-\ntheoretical characteristics of texts with their style and literary quality. However, for the most part, such studies were motivated by practical applications like text\ncompression. The only systematic study of entropy as a function of style, period, and author that I am aware of is Paisley (1966). Though it employed a very crude\nentropy estimate (by frequencies of two-letter sequences), a systematic difference\nwas found between prose and poetry texts, the latter having higher entropy, i.e., information density, in agreement with expectations. \n\nHowever, if we attempt to naively apply information-theoretic concepts to poetry, two paradoxes immediately arise. First, the constraints of poetic form, such as meter,\nalliteration, and rhyme, restrict the pool of words that can fill a given place in the line and so should decrease unpredictability and entropy, rather than increase it. Call\nthis The Form Paradox. Second, according to Shannon’s theory, the highest entropy is found in a completely random character sequence, where all characters occur with equal frequency and independently of each other. But a random sequence of letters (or words) can’t form a meaningful text, so it’s not even clear in what sense it can be treated as containing information. Call this The Nonsense Paradox.","x":-1125,"y":-2614,"width":512,"height":534},

In essence, the amount of information in a sequence is a function of its unpredictability. A sequence in which every element (symbol) can be predicted with certainty carries no information. Conversely, the more unexpected each element is, the higher the entropy and therefore the higher the information density. This principle can be directly applied to the study of literature, and particularly poetry, where language is often purposefully dense and layered.\n\nShannon himself experimented on the predictability of text by having participants guess the next letter in a sequence of symbols from randomly selected excerpts. The results highlighted significant differences in the information density between various kinds of text. Later studies, such as those by Fónagy (1961), compared the guess rates of characters in poetry, newspaper articles, and casual conversation, finding substantially higher entropy in poetry. Specifically, poetry exhibited a guess rate of only 40%, compared to 67% in newspapers and 71% in conversations.\n\nThis elevated unpredictability in poetry can be attributed to its defamiliarization techniques—unusual word choices, syntactic deviations, and unique phonic patterns—all of which contribute to its high information density. The unexpected elements not only enrich the semantic content but also engage the reader's cognitive faculties more intensely, achieving a poetic \"economy of language\" that traditional prose often does not.\n\nShannon's framework thus provides a quantifiable method to analyze the information density of poetic texts, bridging the gap between intuitive notions of literary richness and empirical measurement. By treating each word as a symbol and evaluating the probabilities of their occurrences within a text, we can objectively measure and compare the information content across different forms of writing.","x":2280,"y":297,"width":640,"height":798,"color":"6"},
		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"c1865cfcfafc89b7","type":"text","text":"### The Form Paradox\n\nFónagy (1961) observed that the rhythmical and phonetic constraints of poetry should theoretically reduce unpredictability and entropy, contradicting his experimental results. Abernathy (1961) similarly remarked, stating that \"poetry uses a considerably circumscribed and impoverished language compared to everyday speech.\" He suggested resolving this paradox by ascribing lower subjective probabilities to poems, implying higher unpredictability despite the limited language. However, this approach is nonconstructive as it lacks a clear method for assigning probabilities to texts and does not explain why these formal restrictions would ideally result in lower probabilities.\n\nA more detailed analysis comes from A.N. Kolmogorov, who approached this paradox by considering the set of all possible texts, and a particular poem as a member of this set, as popularized by Lotman (1977). Kolmogorov theorized that a poet selects or finds a text that conveys the desired meaning while satisfying formal constraints. For instance, if we consider all character sequences up to the length of \"War and Peace,\" a small subset would be grammatically correct and meaningful texts. Within this model, each sequence either has no meaning or exactly one, and different meanings can be distinguished.\n\nKolmogorov proposed subdividing texts into equivalence classes by synonymy. Each class contains texts that express the same meaning in different ways. For example, the class of texts expressing the meaning of \"Eugene Onegin\" would be large enough to include a text composed in Onegin stanzas. In this context, the logarithm of the number of synonymy classes represents the content capacity entropy (h1), and the average number of ways to express a given meaning represents the flexibility entropy (h2).\n\nFormal constraints in poetry reduce the pool of admissible texts, characterized by a negative entropy (β). Kolmogorov proposed that poetry is possible only when β < h2, suggesting that languages with sufficient flexibility can accommodate poetic forms despite their restrictive rules. However, the notion that a subset of literary texts forms part of the corpus of meaningful texts introduces complexity. The admissibility of texts, especially in poetry, is somewhat fuzzy since what is barely acceptable in prose may be perfectly acceptable in poetry.\n\nKolmogorov's later work on algorithmic complexity theory suggests this paradoxical view led him to explore more robust definitions of text complexity. His idea that the complexity of a text like \"War and Peace\" can be uniquely defined aligns with this progression. Uspensky's preface to Kolmogorov’s notes introduces the idea that some poetic lines, though nonsensical, fit within this expanded corpus.\n\nMetaphor and metonymy in poetry often violate standard semantic norms to create new meanings, as seen in phrases like \"the curtain of the night fell upon us\" or \"Juliet is the sun.\" Such tropes expand the space of admissible texts semantically. Syntactic violations, driven by poetic demands, further illustrate this flexibility. For example, Gerard Manley Hopkins emphasized themes by altering standard word order, as in \"Mortal my mate...\" instead of \"My mortal mate,\" exemplifying how syntax can be manipulated for poetic emphasis.\n\nIn summary, while poetic form narrows the pool of admissible texts statistically, various poetic devices counteract by expanding it. These devices push the boundaries of standard language syntax and semantics, preventing the language of poetry from becoming \"considerably circumscribed and impoverished\" and maintaining or even increasing its entropy.","x":2980,"y":215,"width":700,"height":1435,"color":"6"},

Shannonian entropy measures the unpredictability of text, while Kolmogorov complexity offers a view of text as a compressed program that evokes specific mental states in the reader.\n\nRelating this to the current research question about whether poetry can improve the information density of embedding data, we can infer the following:\n\n1. **Shannonian Entropy**: Poetry’s heightened unpredictability (higher entropy) due to its use of unique linguistic constructs suggests that it has a higher information density than ordinary text. This aligns with the hypothesis that poetry can enhance the effectiveness of data embedding by increasing the amount of information transmitted per unit length.\n\n2. **Kolmogorov Complexity**: Since poetry is seen as a highly compressed linguistic form that distills complex meanings and emotions into a compact form, it could efficiently encode data. If embedding data within a poetic structure, the inherent complexity and density of poetry can potentially allow for more efficient and subtle data embedding techniques, leveraging its compactness and richness of expression.\n\nThus, applying information-theoretic concepts to poetry suggests that its structured yet dense form could indeed enhance the information density of embedded data, making poetry a potentially effective medium for such tasks.","x":2000,"y":1497,"width":800,"height":617,"color":"6"},
		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"af9be0387fc1a75c","type":"text","text":"## Beyond Entropy\n\nThough the Shannonian paradigm has proven quite productive in its applications to literary analysis, it is not the only possible information-theoretic approach. Kolmogorov complexity, roughly defined as the length of the shortest program that generates a given text, offers another intriguing perspective. As Manin and Manin (2017) suggest, natural language can be viewed not only as a carrier of information but also as a program that operates within the brain of the receiver, aiming to induce a specific cognitive or emotional state.\n\nThis perspective is especially pertinent to poetry, whose primary goal often transcends the mere conveyance of information and targets the evocation of emotion and profound contemplation. It is often stated that powerful poetry compresses its language such that to fully encapsulate its meaning, one might need to elaborate extensively in prose. Hence, it could be argued that a great poem represents a maximally Kolmogorov-compressed form of the intended mental state.\n\nGiven that Kolmogorov complexity is non-computable, determining the most compressed description of anything—be it a mental state, an image, or a situation described in a poem—cannot be algorithmically achieved in an efficient manner. This underscores the inherently creative aspect of poetry, as crafting such compressed representations is a task beyond algorithmic calculation.\n\nRecent work by Grietzer (2017a, 2017b) delves into a related domain utilizing a vivid and concrete methodology. Grietzer employs autoencoders, a class of machine-learning algorithms founded on neural network architecture. These autoencoders are trained on large corpora to learn transformations that map input spaces to low-dimensional representation spaces, thereby embodying compression algorithms. Although generally lossy, this compression retains an invariant manifold—a set of points that can be compressed and reconstructed without loss.\n\nEvery human being naturally forms an internal low-dimensional representation of the world. Important features, both universal and unique, are encapsulated within this representation. Essentially, each individual functions as an autoencoder. When one aims to share a unique perspective with others, the optimal approach is to publish their invariant manifold, allowing others to train on it. This process describes the creation and consumption of art and literature.\n\nThis analogy intriguingly circumvents the non-computability issue associated with Kolmogorov complexity. Instead of seeking the shortest description of a predefined world fragment, an author starts with an existing short description and constructs a corresponding world fragment. While this breaks down somewhat given art's symbolic nature, the paradigm remains robust and promising for further exploration.","x":2198,"y":417,"width":602,"height":1112,"color":"6"},

Quoting Manin and\nManin (2017) (see also Manin, 2003): A natural language message is usually treated as carrying information. But it also can be treated as a program that runs in the brain of the receiver and whose purpose is to create a certain mind state in it. This interpretation is particularly interesting for literary texts, especially poetry, because their purpose is not conveying information, but rather imparting an emotional state to the reader. It is customary to state that successful poetry compresses its language and, consequently, if one wants to fully explicate the “meaning” of a good poem, an extensive prose text has to be written. So perhaps the right way to conceptualize a great poem is to say that it represents a maximally Kolmogorov-compressed representation of the target mind state.  Note that because Kolmogorov complexity is not computable, finding the maximally compressed description of something – whether a target mind state or an image, a scene, and a situation being described in the poem – is necessarily a creative act, something that can’t be done with an algorithm (faster than brute-force enumeration). Although this idea seems quite speculative, a recent work by Grietzer (2017a,b) explores a closely related territory in a spectacularly concrete fashion. Grietzer’s main instrument is autoencoders, a class of machine-learning algorithms based on the neural network architecture. An autoencoder is “trained” on a large corpus of objects from a multidimensional feature space and “learns” a transformation that maps this input space into a low-dimensional representation space. In other words, a trained autoencoder embodies a compression algorithm. This algorithm is\nreversible, so that any point in the representation space can be mapped back into the\ninput space, but it is also, generally speaking, lossy, i.e., the reverse mapping will\nnot necessarily reconstruct the original object exactly.\n\nHowever, there is an important low-dimensional submanifold in the input space,\nnamely, the set of its points the trained neural net learned to project into. We can\ncall it the invariant manifold, because the objects belonging to it are compressed\nby the autoencoder losslessly and can be reconstructed from their representations\nexactly. A crucial property of the invariant manifold is that the best way to recreate\nthe same mapping in another autoencoder is to train it on the first autoencoder’s\ninvariant manifold. (Of course, when dealing with computer software, it’s easier to\njust copy the trained state to another instance, but that only works for instances with\nidentical architecture.)  This is where art and literature come in. Everyone perceives the world by constructing an internal lower-dimensional representation of it. Only the most\nimportant features of the objects and events are represented there. Some important\nfeatures are more or less shared by all people; others are defined by one’s unique\nperspective and personality. So every human essentially embodies an autoencoder.\nSuppose one wants to share one’s unique perspective on the world (or, rather, a\nfragment of it) with others. The best way to do it is to publish one’s invariant\nmanifold (or, rather, a consistent piece of it) and let others train themselves on it.\nThis describes creating artwork and reading/viewing/listening to it.  Interestingly, this description seems to circumvent the non-computability prob-lem of Kolmogorov complexity, because instead of trying to find the shortest description of a predefined fragment of the world, the author takes an existing short description and constructs a fragment of the world best described by it. But of course, the analogy is somewhat broken at this point, because a work of art is not (usually) a literal fragment of the world, but a symbolic representation of it. Nevertheless, this looks like a very powerful paradigm with a great promise.","x":-317,"y":-516,"width":325,"height":247},

In  the same collection where that article was published, we find a short, but insightful, article by Abernathy (1961) where the same idea is put in this striking way: “poetry uses a considerably circumscribed and impoverished language compared to the everyday speech.” Abernathy proposed to resolve this paradox by ascribing a subjective probability to each message and postulating that poems are characterized by a drastically lower probability, i.e., higher unexpectedness, despite the fact\nthat they use “a considerably circumscribed” language. Unfortunately, this is a\nrather nonconstructive approach, since it is not clear how to ascribe probabilities\nto texts, and, more importantly, why or whether lower probability would result from\nsatisfying formal restrictions.\n\nA much more detailed exploration of this paradox is due to A.N. Kolmogorov, a\ngreat mathematician with a deep interest in literature. In a series of unpublished (at\nthe time) works popularized by Lotman (1977) (see also Kolmogorov, 1997; Yaglom\nand Yaglom, 1983), he was developing a formalized approach based on considering\na set of all possible texts and a particular poem as a member of this set. A poet can\nbe seen as selecting or finding the text that expresses the desired meaning and at the\nsame time satisfies some formal constraints.  As an illustration, consider the set of all character sequences, say, no longer than War and Peace. It is a very large, but finite, number. There would be in this set a small subset of grammatically correct and meaningful Russian texts. In this highly idealized model, we don’t care what exactly the “meaning” is, but we postulate that each character sequence has either no meaning or exactly one, and that given any two “meanings” we can always say whether they are the same or different. Subdivide all texts into equivalence classes by synonymy, so that each class contains texts that all mean the same. In other words, each class would express in all possible ways\nsome content different from that of the other classes. Consider the synonymy class\nin which all texts express the meaning of, say, Eugene Onegin. If this class is large\nenough, one can find in it a text that is composed in Onegin stanzas, which is what\na poet does. Then the number of synonymy classes would be equal to the number of meanings expressible with texts no longer than War and Peace, and the average number of\ntexts in each class is essentially the number of different ways to express any given\nmeaning. According to Kolmogorov, the former quantity (or rather, its logarithm)\nreflects the “content capacity entropy” of the language (h1 ), while the latter one\nreflects its “flexibility entropy” (h2 ). If the flexibility entropy is large enough, i.e.,\nif the given content can be expressed in a large enough number of ways, one can expect to find among those ways some that also satisfy the formal restrictions of\nversification. Because formal constraints reduce the pool of admissible texts, they\ncan be characterized by a negative entropy (β), and Kolmogorov proposed that\nversification is only possible in languages where β < h2 . Of course, one can’t get rid of the feeling that something is wrong in this picture.  Cf. the uncharacteristically impressionistic passage in a classical text on probability and information (Yaglom and Yaglom, 1983, p. 214):\nHowever, in the compositions of many eminent poets the decrease in the information content of one text letter, related to the fulfilment of known formal rules, is apparently compensated for to a great extent by the enhanced radiance and unconventionality of language. Therefore, it can be well expected that here the redundancy of the language has the same order as that of a prose literary text.  I suppose Kolmogorov felt that way too, which is why he apparently never published his model. In fact, in an undated manuscript (Kolmogorov, 2002) first published by Uspensky (2002), he wrote: “Poetry admits somewhat freer use of word order unconventional in prose, which somewhat increases [the flexibility entropy].” This essentially means that the basic notion of the set of all admissible\ntexts is somewhat fuzzy: what is barely admissible in prose can be quite admissible\nin poetry. But if the statistical population is not well defined, probability and,\nhence, information are also ill-defined. One can even surmise that it was this train\nof thought that eventually led Kolmogorov to propose his algorithmic complexity\ntheory. There is a telling remark in his groundbreaking paper (Kolmogorov, 1968)\nafter the introduction of what is now known as Kolmogorov complexity: “such\nquantities as the ‘complexity’ of the text of ‘War and Peace’ can be assumed to\nbe defined with what amounts to uniqueness.”  Uspensky in his preface to the publication of Kolmogorov’s notes (Uspensky, 1997) also admits that “the very notion that the corpus of literary texts is only a subset of the corpus of meaningful texts” requires rethinking and gives an example of the famous nonsense line from a poem by the Russian modernist\npoet Kruchenykh, consisting of three meaningless monosyllabics “Dyr bul shchyl”\n(Perloff, 2017, p. 73). Note, however, that while Kolmogorov pointed out the\nrelaxation of syntactic norms in poetry, Uspensky’s example hints at the possible\nrelaxation of semantic norms. In fact, such relaxation is well-known to literary scholars. We are used to the notion of metaphor as a specific feature of poetry and literary prose, but most  metaphors are literally absurd phrases, inadmissible by the standard semantics of\nthe language, as one can see with any textbook example like “the curtain of the\nnight fell upon us” or “Juliet is the sun.” So it’s easy to see that metaphor (as well as\nmetonymy and other tropes) already serves to expand the space of admissible texts\nin the semantic dimension. \\\n\nAs for syntactic expansion, an obvious example is the word order violation often arising from the demands of poetic form. However, not all syntactic oddities arise for purely technical reasons. Many figures of speech known and meticulously catalogued at least since antiquity are particular ways to enhance expression by violating rules of syntax. Consider, for example, the opening of G.M. Hopkins’1006 D. Manin\npoem “To His Watch”: “Mortal my mate. . . ” (Hopkins and Blaisdell, 2013, p. 84).\nFrom the point of view of rhythm, the standard word order, “My mortal mate,”\nwouldn’t be any inferior, but Hopkins forcefully emphasizes mortality, the theme of\nthe poem, by shifting the word to the syntactically awkward initial position.\nTo summarize, it appears that although poetic form does narrow down the\nstatistical population of all admissible texts, various poetic devices counteract\nby expanding it and by pushing the boundaries of the standard language syntax\nand semantics. In this way, they keep the language of poetry from becoming\n“considerably circumscribed and impoverished” (Abernathy, 1961) and prevent entropy reduction\n","x":93,"y":-1110,"width":400,"height":306},

However, haikus exemplify how brevity can enhance meaning by focusing on subtle yet powerful expressions. The rigid structure forces poets to choose each word with utmost care, ensuring that every element contributes significantly to the overall impact. \n\nIn terms of information theory, the haiku's succinct nature compresses a wealth of meaning into a few syllables, thus increasing the semantic density of the text. The deliberate choice of words and the evocation of layered imagery and emotion adhere to the idea that poetry can be more information-rich per unit length compared to prose. Each haiku essentially creates its own compact language, rich in meaning and resonance despite the limited use of words.\n\nFurthermore, haikus often employ the technique of juxtaposition, placing two images or ideas in close proximity to one another. This not only adds to the aesthetic quality but also introduces additional layers of meaning and complexity, increasing the unpredictability and expanding the set of all admissible texts in the context of poetry. By breaking away from conventional syntax and semantics, haikus push the boundaries of language, demonstrating that even within strict formal constraints, poetry can achieve high information density.\n\nIn conclusion, haikus illustrate how the principles of information theory apply to poetry, reinforcing the notion that artistic constraints can actually enhance, rather than diminish, the expressive power of a literary work.

By considering measures such as Shannon's unexpectedness and Kolmogorov complexity, we argue that the structured yet dense nature of poetry can optimize data representation and enhance the expressive power of linguistic models. The study examines the implications of poetic encoding on knowledge topology and the coherence of information both with and without context, providing a novel approach to improving embedding techniques.\n\n---\n\n### Introduction\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) increasingly relies on embeddings—numerical vector representations of words or sentences—to capture and manipulate semantic information. Traditional embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and more recent transformer models like BERT and GPT, strive to represent the subtleties of human language. We propose that poetry, with its high information density and inherent structure, can offer valuable insights into improving these embeddings.\n\n### Poetry and Information Theory\n\nPoetry compresses a wealth of meaning into a minimal number of words using carefully chosen language and structural constraints. From an information theory perspective, this compression reflects high entropy, as introduced by Shannon's measure of unexpectedness, and an efficient encoding of complex ideas.\n\n### High Entropy and Information Density\n\n1. **Unexpected Elements and Entropy**: Poetry features unconventional syntax and semantics, increasing entropy and providing richer contexts. This higher information density challenges embedding models to capture subtler distinctions in language.\n2. **Self-defining Language**: By creating unique linguistic patterns, poetry pushes the boundaries of syntax and semantics. Models trained on such data might better capture the creative and novel uses of language.\n3. **Reduction of Textual Synonymy**: Poetry's precise and nuanced use of language can help embedding models differentiate subtle variations in meaning, improving tasks like text generation, translation, and sentiment analysis.\n\n### The Form Paradox\n\nDespite the strict formal constraints of poetic forms like haikus, sonnets, and villanelles, these structures often enhance the depth and resonance of the conveyed meaning. This Form Paradox suggests that such constraints can facilitate higher information density, compelling models to learn efficient and potent linguistic representations.\n\n### Theory of Defamiliarization and Lack of Synonymity\n\nThe theory of defamiliarization posits that poetry makes the familiar strange, thereby enhancing perception and understanding. This defamiliarization and the deliberate lack of synonymity in poetry can enrich embedding models by exposing them to a broader array of linguistic and semantic contexts.\n\n### Application in Embeddings\n\n1. **Enhanced Embedding Representations**: Training modern embedding techniques on high-entropy texts like poetry can help models capture richer, more nuanced word representations.\n2. **Improved Predictive Power**: Embeddings that incorporate the structured unpredictability of poetry might generalize better, enhancing performance across NLP tasks.\n3. **Applications**: Such enriched embeddings can benefit various applications, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation, by offering a more comprehensive understanding of language.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIntegrating poetic principles and high-entropy text into the training of embedding models presents a promising avenue for enhancing NLP capabilities. By leveraging the information density and structural discipline inherent in poetry, we aim to create embeddings that are not only more efficient but also more expressive and robust in handling the complexities of human language.\n\n---\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\nFuture research can further explore applying computational models to encode and decode poetry, measure the impact on different NLP tasks, and develop specialized algorithms that incorporate these insights for broader applications in artificial intelligence and digital humanities.","x":-300,"y":3440,"width":700,"height":1705,"color":"6"},

These embeddings aim to capture semantic meaning compactly and efficiently. Poetry, characterized by its dense and layered use of language, offers an interesting case study for examining information density in embeddings.\n\n1. **Information Density in Embeddings**: Embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT learn representations of words that capture semantic meanings based on their context. The idea that poetry has high information density aligns with these models because poetry tends to use words in unexpected or unique ways, potentially leading to more informative word embeddings.\n\n2. **Entropy and Semantic Compression**: Poetry’s elevated entropy, as discussed, means it contains many unexpected elements. Embedding models trained on such data might better capture nuanced meanings and relationships between words, making them more effective for downstream NLP tasks.\n\n3. **Form Paradox and Embeddings**: The constraints of poetic form (meter, rhyme) do not necessarily reduce information density in embeddings. Modern NLP models can disentangle stylistic elements from semantic content, potentially learning richer embeddings from poetry’s constrained but dense usage.\n\n4. **Nonsense Paradox in Context**: Meaningful embeddings rely on capturing context and relational semantics. While random sequences have high entropy, they lack coherent semantic content. Poetry's structured but dense language offers a middle ground, providing high entropy without sacrificing meaning, which is ideal for creating rich embeddings.\n\nBy exploring how embeddings trained on poetic texts differ from those trained on prose or utilitarian language, researchers can gain insights into improving models that require understanding and generating nuanced, dense information.","x":-300,"y":2197,"width":635,"height":820,"color":"6"},

Traditional forms of text, such as prose, have been extensively used for training embedding models. However, the unique characteristics of poetry offer an untapped resource for enhancing information density in these embeddings. This paper explores how poetic structures, with their high entropy and creative language use, can contribute to the development of richer, more efficient embeddings.\n\n#### High Entropy in Poetry\n\nPoetry is known for its high entropy due to the use of unexpected word combinations, creative syntax, and layered meanings. Unlike prose, which prioritizes clarity and predictability, poetry often breaks conventional linguistic norms to evoke strong emotions and vivid imagery. This inherent unpredictability translates to higher information density. By introducing diverse and uncommon word relationships, poetry challenges models to capture more nuanced semantic associations.\n\n#### Embedding Techniques\n\nModern embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformer-based models like BERT and GPT, aim to encode textual data into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors encapsulate semantic similarities and contextual relationships between words. Training these models on poetic texts could extend their learning to encompass broader linguistic variations and richer semantic contexts.\n\n1. **Word2Vec and GloVe**: These methods create embeddings by analyzing word co-occurrence patterns in large text corpora. Incorporating poetry can introduce rare co-occurrences and metaphoric language, enhancing the model's ability to capture subtle semantic nuances.\n\n2. **Transformers (BERT, GPT)**: Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to consider contextual relationships. Poetry's dense and evocative language can help these models understand deeper contextual connections, improving their ability to generate and interpret complex text.\n\n#### Poetic Constraints and Semantic Compression\n\nDespite the formal constraints of poetry (e.g., meter, rhyme), the high information density remains. The Form Paradox suggests that structured constraints do not necessarily reduce information content but can actually enhance it by compelling poets to choose words with precision. Embedding models can learn to identify and preserve these dense information patterns, creating embeddings that are both compact and semantically rich.\n\n#### Applications and Implications\n\n1. **Text Classification**: Richer embeddings can improve the accuracy of text classification tasks by better capturing nuanced semantic information, leading to more refined categorization.\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding the emotional subtleties in poetry can enhance sentiment analysis models, allowing them to detect complex emotional cues more effectively.\n3. **Machine Translation**: Poetry’s unique language patterns can improve translation models, enabling them to handle idiomatic and metaphorical expressions with greater accuracy.\n4. **Creative AI**: Embeddings derived from poetic texts can enhance AI's ability to generate creative and coherent literary pieces, contributing to advancements in creative writing tools.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIntegrating the high entropy and distinctive semantic characteristics of poetry into embedding models can significantly enhance their information density and predictive power. By leveraging the rich, compact language of poetry, NLP models can achieve a more profound understanding of linguistic nuances, leading to improvements across various applications. This research paves the way for further exploration into the symbiotic relationship between poetic forms and computational linguistics.","x":571,"y":3200,"width":749,"height":1525,"color":"6"},
