The world is long overdue for a completely new
system of governance.
!
If there was ever a need for political representation
or a paternalistic and opaque authority, it has been
removed by technology. Every political system we have
tried has proven incapable of protecting human rights and
dignity. Every political system we have tried has devolved
into oligarchy. To effect the change we require
immediately, to give individuals control and responsibility,
to bring regional systems under regional governance,
allow global collaboration and protect the heritage of
future generations, we need a new political model.
!
Corporations have the freedom to live in a world
without borders or social responsibility, to own property
no individual can claim and to control a one world
government and legal system. This has had insupportable
consequences for the world’s resources and individual
rights. People are locked within arbitrary national borders
by ever increasing surveillance, military and xenophobic
propaganda, crippling our ability to collaborate and
frequently, our ability to survive. Our naturally migratory
species are being caged like zoo animals, increasingly even
as technology makes it more possible for us to interact.
Immigration has become a privilege of the elite instead of a
right of the desperate. The world’s people are being
divided not into naturally forming communities but into
corporate controlled economic markets. Governance by
nation states is now as arbitrary and illogical as city states
were earlier found to be.
!
The accelerated pace and power of global
communication strains and bursts the old systems of
control. People can walk en masse across borders, shun the
current financial system, establish our own trade, createtransparency and provide emergency assistance to each
other. This power to dismantle the structures we have
relied on is terrifying to many because there is no clear
path ahead, and few structures have yet formed to replace
the ones that are crumbling. The growth of extreme
nationalists and traditionalists worldwide, the buildup of
militaries and intelligence monitoring are indicative of this
fear of our unknown future. Old authoritarian systems can
no longer bind the natural chaos of a free society, but we
can show the power of chaotic order, the beauty and
creativity of collaborative freedom, if we build the right
structures now.
!
The transference of old ideas to our new
capabilities has so far mostly served to prove the
ridiculousness of the old ideas, not provide alternatives.
The hilarity of the Bitcoin stock market is a funhouse
mirror of the old stock market but does not provide a
marked difference in approach. The instant celebrity and
celebrity power of social media is a more transparent and
gameable but no less ridiculous version of celebrity
influence. We now have the opportunity to create real
alternatives for both economy and influence, for
communication, collaboration and all tools of society. If we
are unaware of the potential before us, we will not achieve
everything we are capable of at this moment. What we are
building with our software and laws at this time is nothing
less than a completely new social structure. It deserves all
of our attention.
