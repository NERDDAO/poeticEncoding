**Introduction**

Current knowledge-sharing systems are becoming obsolete due to their reliance on central control, which hinders growth and innovation. To address these concerns, a decentralized protocol named Proof of Knowledge (PoK) is introduced. The PoK protocol ensures security and distributes rewards equitably by maintaining a balance between sharing and securing knowledge.

**kEngrams Definition**

In this system, kEngrams are nodes of knowledge designed to build a comprehensive and interconnected understanding. These nodes form the basic building blocks for knowledge sharing and utilization.

*Components of an Engram*

A kEngram includes:
1. Study questions or problems.
2. Data and metadata to contextualize the information.
3. Unique identification for differentiation and tracking.

These components are interlinked to form a coherent structure, enabling robust and complex data relationships.

**Engram Life-cycle**

A kEngram goes through various stages:
1. Composition – Initial creation and structuring.
2. Usage – Active implementation and data gathering.
3. Evolution – Continuous enrichment and updates over time.

Ethereum blockchain technology is used to mark these stages, ensuring transparency and immutability.

**Utilizing Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)**

The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is an integral part of the PoK protocol. It ensures that all Engram trails are secure and transparent, facilitating fair reward distribution and maintaining the integrity of the knowledge-sharing process.

**Defining an Engram Schema for Proof of Knowledge**

A well-structured schema for kEngrams is essential for efficiency, particularly in terms of gas consumption on the Ethereum blockchain. The schema details include all necessary elements for defining and organizing a kEngram.

**Addition of Value**

Engrams increase in value by being linked to other relevant data and through iterative revisions by various contributors. This networked growth amplifies the knowledge encapsulated within each Engram.

**Validation of Engrams**

Validation involves AI mechanisms ensuring that the usage and interaction with the kEngrams confirm their quality and relevance. This automated process helps maintain high standards of information.

**Role of Human Operators**

Human operators are responsible for overseeing the coherence of kEngrams, guiding the flow of information, and ensuring that the network maintains logical integrity.

**Local to Global Coherence**

The local interactions and connections among kEngrams contribute to a global coherence, resulting in a unified Knowledge Graph. This graph represents a comprehensive alignment of all the decentralized nodes of understanding.

**Knowledge Validation & Value Attribution**

The open market allows for the merit-based evaluation of kEngrams. The value and utility of each node are determined by its use and acceptance over time, leading to a dynamic and evolving knowledge system.

**Utilization & Evolution**

AI algorithms play a critical role in identifying valuable kEngrams. User interactions and metrics further shape the relevance and fate of these engrams. This continuous feedback loop ensures that the knowledge base remains both current and useful.

Search functionalities adapt based on contributions, and continuous collaborative efforts foster the growth and evolution of shared knowledge.

**Conclusion**

The PoK protocol leverages blockchain to ensure the truth and transparency of knowledge. It supports an adaptive, decentralized approach to knowledge sharing and rewards contributions equitably, fostering a thriving ecosystem for shared intellectual growth.
