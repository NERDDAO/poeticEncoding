*Information Theory in Poetry and Literature**

Old and new ideas,
By information theory,
Merge into one form.

Language's borders,
Pushed by poems into new,
Boundless realms of thought.

Word combinations,
Unusual yet intact,
Carry deeper truths.

Relaxed language rules,
Create new harmonies,
Words fit perfectly.

This journey begins,
Future insights will unfold,
Poetry expands.
