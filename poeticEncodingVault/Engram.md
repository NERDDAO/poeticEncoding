An **engram** is a unit of [cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition") information imprinted in a physical substance, theorized to be the means by which [memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory") are stored[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_%28neuropsychology%29#cite_note-1) as [biophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics "Biophysics") or [biochemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_%28neuropsychology%29#cite_note-2) changes in the brain or other [biological tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_tissue "Biological tissue"), in response to external stimuli.

Demonstrating the existence of, and the exact mechanism and location of, neurologically defined engrams has been a focus of persistent research for many decades.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_%28neuropsychology%29#cite_note-Levy-3)
