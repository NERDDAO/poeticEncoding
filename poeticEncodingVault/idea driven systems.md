Idea driven systems

“Turing believes machines think. Turing lies with men.
Therefore machines cannot think.” – Alan Turing

Representative democracies are part of a
personality driven celebrity culture where people are
encouraged to support their chosen personalities or groups
in any action they take. This has changed from recent
history, where celebrity culture existed but was moderated.
People were encouraged to choose principles they
supported and ensure those principles were met by any
action, regardless of the actor. The advantage of a
personality driven system to those in power is it allows
them to disregard the principles agreed to in a social
contract. It also makes favour swapping and influence
peddling the preferred methods of negotiation rather than
simply negotiating each action on its own merits, a
situation apparent in representative governance
assemblies such as the United Nations.

When any criticism of an action taken by person A
is met by cries that you must then support person B, we
are dealing with a personality driven system. When similar
actions that make Zimbabwe’s President Mugabe an
alleged war criminal make the United States President
Obama a Nobel Peace Prize winner, we are dealing with a
personality driven system. When no action taken by a
person ‘you support’ must ever be criticized, when we are
encouraged to just trust an authority with no knowledge of
their actions, when we are given the opportunity to vote
for a person instead of actions, we are dealing with a
personality driven system. This allows us no real control
over our governance or the actions taken by our society at
all. In representative democracy, far more of the public’stime is spent debating what ought to be completely
irrelevant personal attributes and studying politicians
instead of policy.

A democratic ideal is a system of laws written to
apply equally to all people in all cases. Many states have
been attempting to circumvent those laws by reclassifying
people as ‘terrorists’ or ‘terrorist groups’ and pretending
these groups are not allowed the same rights as others, in
direct contradiction to the underlying principles. ‘Two
wrongs don’t make a right’, once a commonly repeated
cliché, is now almost never heard. It is widely accepted
that wrongs towards some people in some cases are a
‘necessary evil’.

The new power of personality driven systems is
being illustrated in wars where all effort is expended
trying to cloud or identify who is behind each group of
fighters, seen horribly in places like Syria and the
Democratic Republic of Congo. The effort to identify
groups is meant to aid allegiances and guide people in
supporting one group of men with guns committing
atrocities or another. An action or idea driven system
would reject all who commit atrocities equally and support
those building society. That is an incredibly simplistic
statement when applied to the two cases above, but the
root evil of investing in men with guns instead of people
building societies is recognized in all areas of the world
which suffer permanent ‘instability’. The solution of just
identifying ‘the good guys’ or deciding ‘there are no good
guys’ was created and is continually promoted by those
selling the weapons.

Where once soldiers were regular civilians who left
their everyday lives to fight in defence of their societies,
and were therefore worthy of the highest honour and
gratitude, those civilians are now called ‘terrorists’,
‘militants’ and ‘unprivileged combatants’ and we are
informed they have no right to fight in wars and are in factwar criminals for doing so. The people who deserve
honour we are told, are professional paid killers, willing to
do anything they are told, not in defence of their society
but in offense to any country they are paid to attack. Our
laws have been twisted to grant impunity to those we once
reviled as mercenaries and make war criminals of those we
once celebrated as heroes.

The disease of personality driven systems extends
to entire groups, where the same action taken by one is
terrorism, by the other is self defence. Most extreme are
those who feel killing babies is justified if Israel is killing
them, or those that feel the United States 2012 NDAA’s
provision for indefinite detainment of US citizens is
horrifying, the US Patriot Act’s same power over everyone
without US citizenship not worthy of notice. The faults of
personality driven systems have been called by many
names, racism, sexism, ageism, nationalism and more, but
all of those -isms mean the same thing. People are being
judged as nouns instead of verbs.
!
If instead of supporting nouns, we supported ideas and
actions, it would be far easier to follow our chosen principles in
all cases.

The groundbreaking social theorists Anonymous
have attempted in the past years to create a hierarchy of
information, an oligarchy of ideas, in an attempt to escape
the pitfalls of personality driven governance. Memes are a
perfect example of concise ideas being shared for the value
of their information with no need of further authority.
Memes can also be used to circumvent censorship. Sina
Weibo users talking about May 35th and other dates to
mean the June 4, 1989 Tiannanmen Square anniversary is
an example of ideas overcoming language control. China
has the fastest moving memes of anywhere in the world
due to the speed of their censors and they have developedingenuous idea and action driven systems to avoid
retribution on personalities. The Sunday stroll of the short
lived Jasmine Revolution15 is one of many examples of
gamified mass protests which everyone can play without
direct instruction from an authority.
!
The promotion of ideas also allows ideas to be
evaluated and fact checked on their own merits rather than
accepted or rejected based on acceptance of the source.
This is the best method of impartial evaluation since bad
data can come from good places and vice versa. It is also
the only way to be heard for voices which are marginalized
otherwise. An idea based culture, where seeming majority
opinions are rejected in favour of facts and individual
assessment, is also the only real defence against
astroturfers and persona management software, used
online to simulate mass support where there is none.
