*Running in Shackles: The Information-Theoretic Paradoxes of Poetry**

## Introduction

Language is our trait,
Poetry's impact obscure—
Info compressed tight.

Shannon's theory speaks,
Dense, rich wisdom in short lines—
Poetry's mystique.

## The Form Paradox

Rhymes and meter bind,
Narrowing word choice yet—
Unexpected blooms.

Kolmogorov's view,
Poet picks from vast meanings—
Text with strict constraints.

## The Nonsense Paradox

Random words make no
Sense, yet peak in entropy—
Content still unsure.

Each word's place reveals,
Language structure's sweet ballet—
Rand yields richness.

## The Curious Case of Missing Synonyms

Words unique, precise,
Hyperbolic claims, yet true—
Poetry's pure state.

Author's freedom vast,
Reader sees ordered cosmos—
Singular meaning.

## A Word in Its Place

Right word, right moment,
Rigid structure helps reveal—
Meaning's pure essence.

Experimental proof,
Form and rhythm amplify—
Semantic surplus.

## Beyond Entropy

Poetry reframes—
Mind states, emotions compressed,
Autoencoder.

Poem’s dense structure,
Invariant manifold—
Sharing worlds profound.

## Conclusion

Language stretched anew,
Poetry's boundless expanse—
Fitting words, one truth.
