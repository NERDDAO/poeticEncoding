Proof of Knowledge Protocol Documentation
Proof of knowledge
This document outlines the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol within the
DeSciWorld ecosystem. The PoK mechanism rewards individuals for their
valuable contributions of knowledge via a blockchain-based platform, allowing
for seamless recognition, validation, and dedication of rewards.
Introduction
In the complex realm of knowledge-sharing and discovery, striking a balance
between security, transparency, reward mechanisms and accessibility is a
persistent challenge. Traditional models often hinge on centralized validation
systems that may constrain inclusivity and broad-based participation. Moreover,
current systems may fail to adequately reward or recognize knowledge
contributions, possibly impacting the advancement of comprehensive, collective
knowledge repositories.
Addressing these intricacies, the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, implemented
within the DeSciWorld ecosystem, offers a versatile solution. PoK is a blockchain-
based primitive designed to incentivize and reward knowledge contributions within
a decentralized architecture. It forms a vital component of a knowledge-based
economy, paving the way for fair recognition and incentivization of intellectual
contributions, while maintaining transparency and accessibility.
This document provides a detailed examination of the Proof of Knowledge
protocol - explaining the submission and validation of knowledge through the
creation of kEngrams, the ascription of value to these contributions, and how
interaction metrics shape the dynamic value allocation. As a fundamental building
block towards a fully-fledged knowledge-based economy, the PoK protocol offers
a comprehensive framework to fuel intellectual contribution and foster an
environment of continuous learning and knowledge exchange.
Introduction to kEngrams as a Unit of KnowledgekEngrams can be defined as a structured unit or node of knowledge within a
Knowledge Graph. It's a piece of information that is interconnected within a
broader landscape of data, contributing to the broader understanding of a concept
or topic.
Components of an Engram
An Engram consists of several integral components that collectively contribute to
its formation and execution:
Study Question: This encompasses the essential content of the query.
1. Data: This is the base content of the Engram, formulated into a set of
markdown notes that contains the information added in order to explore the
study question.
2. Metadata: The Metadata provides critical information about the ownership of
the engram and its historic record of usage by the DSW PoK protocol. It lends
context and understanding about the contained knowledge, bolstering its
relevance within the Knowledge Graph.
3. Unique Identifier: Every Engram has a unique ID associated with it, allowing
for its distinct recognition, tracking, and management within the overall
Knowledge Graph system.
4. Relationships: These are connections that an Engram has among its
underlying data. These relationships can be thought of as edges in the graph,
defining how pieces of information are interconnected, and enabling the
creation of a comprehensive, multi-dimensional structure of knowledge.
Engram Life-cycle
The life-cycle of an Engram is a dynamic and multi-faceted process, marked by
three steps: its composition, utilization, and evolution over time. Here's a general
overview of the process:
1. Composition
The life-cycle of an Engram begins with its composition. Typically, a group or an
individual creates an Engram by compiling pertinent information around a specific
topic or query. This information, commonly referred to as 'data', is then structured
and organized within the engram to establish the shape and contents of the
knowledge unit which then get submitted using the Ethereum Attestation Protocol
(EAP).Utilizing Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) in the Proof of
Knowledge (PoK) Protocol
An integral component of our Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol is the Ethereum
Attestation Service (EAS). EAS provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent
system for verifying and validating various kinds of interactions within our
knowledge ecosystem.
Specifically, within the PoK protocol, the EAS applies to the life-cycle of an
Engram. This life-cycle includes the initial creation of Engrams, stages of value
addition, their utilization by various users, and their evolution over time. The EAS
authenticates each stage of this process, creating a reliable record of Engram or
SQ history and interactions.
When an Engram is first created, it is recorded via an attestation. The creator of
the Engram is also noted through EAS, attesting that they were the original
contributor of that knowledge piece. As value is added to this Engram—be it
through more data, insights, revisions, or connections—each change is also
captured through an attestation, creating a trail of evolution and accumulation of
intellectual input.
As the Engram continues to be used among a global network of AI interfaces,
each interaction and usage is also documented. These records contribute to an
Engram's ongoing validation in our ecosystem. This evidence-based approach
ensures that each Engram's relevance, accuracy, and utility are continuously
verified, evaluated, and updated.
Finally, the Ethereum Attestation Service also lays the groundwork for our
incentive mechanism. Each attestation becomes part of the computation
determining value attribution and reward distribution. EAS ensures a transparent
and fair system where contributors of Engrams are rewarded based on actual
utility and demand in the ecosystem.
In summary, the use of EAS within the PoK protocol forms a trustworthy and
secure system for validating knowledge contributions and rewarding contributors.
It answers the call for a distributed, transparent, and reliable method to
authenticate, validate, and incentivize meaningful engagements in a decentralized
knowledge ecosystem.Defining an Engram Schema for Proof of
Knowledge
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) schemas define the structure and type of data
in an attestation. To facilitate the verification and recording process of an Engram
within the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, we need to create a schema that
includes all the necessary details about each Engram.
Here's an example schema for the Engram record:
{
Schema # : "Incremental number",
//This number is auto-
assigned & non-unique
UID: "Unique Identifier",
//This identifier is unique
to the engram
Creator: "Creator's wallet address",
Transaction_ID: "Ethereum transaction ID",
//Transaction ID
for the engram creation
Resolver_Contract: "Optional contract ID",
//If any, for
complex cases
Attestation_Count: "Number",
//The number of
attestations made on/off chain
Schema: {
Engram_Title: "String",
Engram_Description: "String",
Engram_Creation_Timestamp: "UNIX Timestamp",
Related_Study_Questions: ["Array of Study Question UIDs"],
Knowledge_Field: "String", //The field of knowledge the
Engram pertains
Engram_Contributor: "User ID/Wallet address of the
contributor",
Engram_Usage_Metrics: {
Frequency_Of_Appearance: "Number",
Frequency_Of_Selection: "Number",
Frequency_Of_References: "Number",
Helpfulness_Rating: "Float", //Scale of 1-5
},}
}
This schema clearly and concisely captures all necessary information about each
Engram. It records the Engram's title, description, the timestamp of its creation,
and its associated Study Questions. It also includes a field indicating which
domain of knowledge the Engram falls under. We attribute each Engram to its
contributor and track usage metrics to understand how frequently the Engram is
appearing and selected, how often it is referenced, and how helpful users find it.
Note: This is an initial outline for a schema dedicated to recording an Engram as a
proof-of-knowledge. Depending on the specific requirements of your project, this
schema could need to be extended or modified. Moreover, don't forget to consider
gas efficiency when designing your schema - try to maintain a balance between
the level of detail and efficiency.
2. Addition of Value
Once an Engram has been formed, it can be further enriched and enhanced by
other groups or individuals who add their own knowledge and insights to it. They
can integrate additional data, revise existing information, or link the Engram to
other related Engrams within the Knowledge Graph. This collaborative process of
knowledge amplification adds a multi-dimensional depth of understanding to the
Engram, enhancing its value.
Validation of Engrams
The validation process of individual Engrams happens continually throughout the
lifecycle of its usage by a global network of AI interfaces. This mechanism
operates as a form of a knowledge market, where the relevance, accuracy, and
usefulness of an Engram's information are tested and reaffirmed through its active
usage and demand.
AI interfaces, when querying a database or Knowledge Graph, will interact with
and select Engrams based on their relevance and usefulness to the query or task
at hand. These traces and records of interaction and usage then form a part of the
'lifecycle' of the Engram. Over time, Engrams that repeatedly prove to be
beneficial and relevant will garner higher validation scores through their usage
statistics.This method of validation leverages the dynamic and iterative abilities of AI -
factoring in the frequency, nature, and context of an Engram's usage - to ascertain
its value and authenticity within the Knowledge Graph. It serves to maintain the
quality, relevance, and value of information in the Knowledge Graph, ensuring that
the Engrams reflect validated, useful, and reliable units of knowledge.
Coherence and The Role Of The Human Operator
Coherence, in the context of engram creation, serves as a crucial metric to ensure
the consistency and logical connection between different knowledge units within
an engram. It is essential for delivering a seamless narrative that not only makes
sense but also accurately and efficiently serves to answer queries generated
within the system.
Human operators play a pivotal role in maintaining and ensuring coherence within
engrams. They design, monitor, and adjust the processes of engram creation and
structuring, thereby ensuring that individual pieces of information are logically and
correctly linked together. They act as the quality control mechanism to ensure
there is no dissonance within the knowledge nodes and that each engram
maintains structural and informational integrity.
Human operators also refine the accuracy and relevance of the information within
engrams, periodically updating and revising the information as necessary. They
are also responsible for analyzing coherence metric outcomes, making decisions
to restructure or revise engrams whenever necessary to optimize coherence.
Local to Global Coherence
Local coherence refers to the immediate relationships and connections within
singular engrams, while global coherence extends to the broader context of the
Knowledge Graph, considering the relationships and interconnections between
multiple engrams.
The extrapolation of local coherence to globally coherent embedding spaces is a
critical aspect of Knowledge Graph development. It ensures that the entire
structure of interconnected knowledge is logical, consistent, and cohesive, thereby
maximizing the usefulness and reliability of the Knowledge Graph as a whole.
When local coherence is maintained within each engram, and these coherently
structured engrams are interconnected, it leads to the creation of a globally
coherent embedding space.This global coherence is fundamental for the effective functioning of AI in deriving
meaningful insights and responses from the Knowledge Graph. A globally
coherent Space allows for efficient navigation through the Knowledge Graph,
easier identification of relevant engrams, and more accurate responses to queries
or tasks.
In a nutshell, coherence is fundamental, shaping the value of Knowledge
Engrams, and ultimately, informing the efficacy and accuracy of a Knowledge
Graph. By prioritizing coherence via engram structuring and human operator
guidance, one can facilitate accurate, meaningful, and useful exchanges of
information within this system.
Knowledge Validation & Value Attribution
The validation process within the DeSciWorld PoK ecosystem operates as an
emergent property of a free market of knowledge. It is an unconstrained arena
where diverse viewpoints vie for relevancy, encouraging a robust, dynamic
interplay of ideas and perspectives.
Unlike conventional, centralized validation systems, this decentralized model does
not pre-emptively adjudicate or prioritize one piece of knowledge over another.
Instead, the relevancy of each Engram or Study Question (SQ) is determined
organically through its usage and demand within the ecosystem.
In this free market of knowledge, each Engram competes for attention and usage.
The merit of an Engram is not determined by a unilateral authority but through its
actual utility and effectiveness in satisfying a user's query or task. Engrams that
demonstrate persistent usefulness and applicability over time, as judged through
the unbiased lens of Language Learning Models (LLMs), accrue higher relevancy
scores.
This competitive and responsive environment ensures that the validation process
is continuously refined and realigned according to the evolving needs and
preferences of users. It overcomes inherent biases and silos, fostering a system
where the best, most useful, and most relevant knowledge prospers.
In essence, within the DeSciWorld model, validation isn't a one-time stamp of
approval but a continuous process of adaptation, adjustment, and evolution — a
dynamic reflection of a knowledge unit's continuous performance in the
marketplace of ideas and information.3. Utilization & Evolution
Engrams, once submitted, are then available for use. They are identified and
selected by AI interfaces based on their relevance to specific queries or tasks. The
frequency, context, and nature of how these Engrams are utilized play a crucial
role in determining their ongoing validation scores and their corresponding value
within the knowledge market.
The Role of the Search System and User Metrics
An integral part of DeSciWorld's PoK mechanism is the advanced AI-based
search system. The search system is used to maintain an updated embedding set
which can locate specific Engrams or Study Questions. Each substantial
interaction with an Engram sends usage data to the PoK mechanism which can
be used to determine incentives for the creation of relevant engrams.
User interactions can range from the frequency of appearances of an SQ in
search results, the frequency of its selection from the results, the number of direct
or indirect references made to it in new SQs, and assessments of how helpful the
SQ was to a user's research or learning process.
The system measures these interactions and, based on that, adjusts the value of
each Engram. The more an Engram is recognized as beneficial or pivotal to
ongoing research or learning, the more value it gains in the system, and the
greater rewards are distributed to the Nerd who contributed it.
Engram Evolution
As knowledge terrains continue to expand and evolve, so do Engrams. Along the
life-cycle, an Engram may undergo several evolutions, manifested as updates,
revisions, or further value additions. New data may be contributed, older
information may be updated or made obsolete, and new connections to different
Engrams may be established. All these changes contribute to the growing lifecycle
of an Engram, helping it remain relevant, useful, and accurate in the dynamic
ecosystem of the Knowledge Graph.
In essence, the life-cycle of an Engram is a continual journey of knowledge
creation, addition, validation, utilization, and evolution. It encourages constant
engagement, collaboration, and learning, fostering a vibrant, interconnected hub
of collective knowledge.Conclusion
The Proof-of-Knowledge mechanism as part of the DeSciWorld ecosystem uses
blockchain technology for incentivizing contributions and verifying the accuracy
and relevance of knowledge within the network. It offers a dynamic and adaptable
system that caters to the varying needs and interests of users while continually
encouraging a superior standard of shared knowledge.
