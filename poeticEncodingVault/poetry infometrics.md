Thinking about poetry and literature in general in terms of information theory turns
out to be surprisingly productive. Many centuries-old notions, as well as relatively
recent developments in the humanities, can be naturally integrated into a cohesive
paradigm. Moreover, recent technological developments make it possible to move
from informed, but informal speculation to verifiable, reproducible results that give
a solid ground to conclusions. Poetry emerges perhaps most importantly as language use that pushes the boundaries of standard syntax and semantics, expanding the set of all admissible texts. A poem can utilize highly unusual word combinations but still maintain a
comfortable level of total redundancy with rich patterning on phonic, morphologic,
and syntactic levels. This effectively increases its meaning-carrying capacity. The 
rules of the underlying language are relaxed and partially replaced with regularities
particular to this specific piece. Thus, a poem can be described as a message that to
some extent defines its own language. This in turn leads to the reduction of textual
synonymy and the feeling of every word fitting harmonically in its place, which
likely is an important component of aesthetic satisfaction.  We are still at the beginning of this journey, and one should expect many new developments in the years to come.
