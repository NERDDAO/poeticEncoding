The proposition that a work of art can model the manifold structure of a real-world distribution is particularly useful as key to Modernist aesthetic theory and practice, in as much as Modernism is associated with a focus on abstract, diffused, ineffable structures of meaning bound to a work’s overall aesthetic form rather than on the more direct fruits of a work’s narrative, rhetorical, and lyrical communication. Specifically, the concept of a trained autoencoder’s manifold provides a strong conceptual interface between three major critical approaches to Modernist works’ ‘abstract, diffused, ineffable’ structures of meanings. The three approaches that concern us are as follows:

**A)** A cultural-Phenomenological approach to Modernist works as portraits of moods or ‘Stimmungen’ (subjects’ representation-spaces), nowadays very actively at play in literary studies. _(cf. Sianne Ngai, Jonathan Flatley)_

[Simplified: a Modernist work aims to demonstrate a way of looking at the world.]

**B)** A formalist-materialist approach to Modernist works as algorithms for the aggregation of textual or cultural materials that together form some weak field of coherence, central to the theory and practice of (speaking real loosely here) ‘conceptual writing.’ _(cf. Tan Lin, Hugh Kenner)_

[Simplified: a Modernist work aims to demonstrate a weak affinity between the many heterogeneous worldly or textual materials it patches together.]

**C)** The Symbolist approach to Modernist (Symbolist) texts as invocations of the ‘correspondences’ or ‘esoteric affinities’ that structure the perceptible surfaces of the world in accordance with ‘primordial Ideals’ that govern the ordinary world of visible phenomena. Associated with the early Modernist writers themselves more than literary studies. _(cf. Charles Baudelaire, Gertrude Stein)_

[Simplified: a Modernist work aims to demonstrate an underlying structure in phenomena that seem unstructured.]

On my account, each of these paradigms identically identifies the ‘meaning’ of a Modernist work with a trained autoencoder’s manifold, _describing one and the same formal structure via different functional definitions_. (Elsewhere, in work geared to the literary theorist, I relate this multifunctionality to Raymond Williams’ appropriately tricky concept of ‘structures of feeling.’)

The integrated story of our three ‘Modernist paradigms,’ under the manifold interpretation, can be told roughly as follows. To begin, let us recall that in unsupervised representation learning, we take a large set of data and learn a set of features that allows us to compressedly represent each piece of data in the set with minimal loss. We can regard this set of features as a ‘mental language,’ in a certain strictly heuristic sense: a trained net’s low-dimensional representation is functionally comparable to sequences of qualified predicates — e.g. ‘somewhat _p_, not _f_, not _q_, barely _t_, very _g_…’ — such that the predicates stay constant from input to input but the qualifiers vary. To the extent that a deep dimensionality reduction is appropriate for some given dataset, the ‘vocabulary’ of the language must approximately track the factors of variation entangled in the data. The features, in other words, must more or less correspond to something like ==Plato’s objects== ==whose ineffably interacting shadows on the cave’s wall are the data==. At the same time, to the extent that a deep dimensionality reduction is appropriate for some dataset, the ‘semantics’ of the resulting ‘vocabulary’ is also likely to be highly non-modular, analytically intractable, and “situated.” With these considerations in mind, calling the features learned in deep dimensionality reduction ‘_esoteric affinities of perceptible surfaces to primordial Ideals_,’ as in **C**, requires little if any poetic license.

Let us also recall, now, that the feature list extracted by unsupervised deep learning is equivalent to a coordinate system on a lower-dimensional manifold in the input space, such that given the feature list we can efficiently ask of new data whether it lies close to this manifold, and with certain further allowances even generate random new data that lies on this manifold. While points on this manifold are not necessarily _similar_ to one another, they collectively have an _affinity_ to one another: as objects generated from the same highly constrained generative ‘language,‘ they share at least of some minimal form of what we might tentatively call a ‘style’ or ‘vibe’ or ‘genre.’ Equivalently, any sufficiently large — relative to the learning algorithm’s complexity — set of datapoints covered by the manifold has an unusually low absolute Kolmogorov complexity (i.e. has high compressibility), a condition which most sciences regard as necessary, but only ambiguously sufficient, for possessing a “meaningful structure.” These structures of affinity are the kind of promising but in and of themselves _‘weak’_ fields of coherence that we know from ‘**B**.’

Finally, recall that once the training of an unsupervised deep learning algorithm is finished, when the algorithm encounters new input data it projects the data into the lower-dimensional manifold (within the input space) corresponding to the feature list. The algorithm ‘keeps’ only the aspects of the data that are captured by the feature list, then treats these feature values as coordinates on the manifold, and then picks the corresponding item on the manifold as the reconstruction of the input data. I propose that quite apart from any implication that a trained unsupervised deep learning algorithm is a good overall analogue for the mind of a human subject, we have good (if provisional) grounds to hold that the problem of locally linear dimensionality reduction is a staple of the “ecological niche” humans and learning algorithms for ‘AI domains’ share. If this is so, then we sometimes have reason to regard a person whose cognition is sensitive to some patterns in the world around her and insensitive to others— a person who excels at seeing certain similarities and differences but erases others — as projecting the worldly things she encounters into a lower-dimensional manifold spanned by her already-trained mental ‘language.’ On this account, we might treat the lower-dimensional manifold we’re learning when our minds are doing a dimensionality reduction on the data in e.g. a Modernist novel as a “reverse engineering” of the lower-dimensional manifold covered by the author’s or narrator’s ‘mental language’ (i.e. feature space). Or better yet, we might treat this manifold as the ‘mental language’ of a new way of seeing for which the novel’s aesthetic meaning is a blueprint. We have arrived, in any case, at one form or another of a _Stimmung_ as in ‘**A**.’

Let’s sum up. I propose that Modernist works are often in the business of teaching you the coordinates of a lower-dimensional manifold in the space of possible data. When we look at the three paradigms for thinking about the cognitive product of Modernist works, ‘**C**’ (’Ideals’) treats learning the manifold as learning the generative model of the data, ‘**A**’ (’Stimmung’) treats learning the manifold as learning the dimensionality reduction method that produced the data as ‘reconstructions’ of other data, and ‘**B**’ (’weak coherence’) treats learning the manifold as learning that a certain set is compressible. In other words, the same thin twisty slice in the input space can be interpreted as the expression of someone’s dimensionality reduction method (re: Stimmung), or as a set of objects that compress together well en masse (re: weak fields of coherence), or as a set of objects such that the difference between any object y and any object x is a principled difference (re: primordial Ideals).
