In a concentric user group, people or ideas
promoted to the center by their peer group receive greatest
amplification and their findings will be audited, amplified
and explained to the general public by outer circles. Note:
Concentric circles relate to sound amplification â€“ the voices or
ideas in the centre are amplified more greatly. They are not
hierarchical as they have no direct control over the actions of
anyone. While transparency will ensure that conversations
at the centre are heard by all, it is unlikely that they will be
understood by those with no knowledge of the system. It is
not reasonable to expect those in the epistemic community
to explain their reasoning to every member of the user
group and attempt to educate every member to an elite
level of understanding, but those of the user group with an
interest have a right to education and understanding of
that which effects them.
!
Communication should not be the full
responsibility of the experts in the centre, but should be
carried over expertise bridges by full transparency and
user participation. It is the responsibility of each user in an
open system to educate themselves to their own level of
comfort using the data and user population at each level to
inform themselves. Their input and decision making
impact would then be commensurate with the expertise
they acquire. The epistemic community in the centre
should not need to protect themselves from demands orattacks from completely uninformed users. The circles of
expertise which promoted them to the centre should also
verify and explain their findings to the outer circles.
!
Ideas can never be furthered if discussion is always
at the level of the novice and the ideas of an expert can
only be tested by other experts with equal understanding
of the topic. In a concentric user group, the receptive field
is stronger near the centre, so informed opinions will be
heard more clearly by experts in the centre, but full
transparency will allow anyone from any part of the
system to be as informed as they wish to be by any other
part.
!
Knowledge bridges allow discussion to be held at
every level of expertise and corrected by those with greater
knowledge. Knowledge bridges also allow input from
casual users to be instantly promoted to be heard by the
epistemic community if the user group finds the points
valid. Knowledge bridges need to ensure that the best
ideas are promoted and disseminated, regardless of the
attractiveness or popularity of the person with the
expertise.
!
Acceptance of ideas must be controlled by the
entire user group, and the user group must always have
the power to shun, thereby removing power from, any
peer promoted expert. This is necessary to avoid a closed
oligarchy but it must be approached warily so that the
amplified voices in the center are the true experts, not the
most populist and attractive choices. It is incumbent on the
user group to protect the center from celebrity grabbing
manipulation if they are not to recreate the populist
systems of representative democracy.
