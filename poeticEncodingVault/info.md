Building upon these observations, I construct a mathematically informed interpretation of a classic literary-theoretic thesis: that a work of literature can effectively communicate an ineffably complex holistic understanding of the real world, which we might call the work’s ‘aesthetic meaning.’ While my discussion focuses on literature, these same considerations may also apply to works of art in other media, to the extent that one can (partially) interpret a given work of art as constructing or curating a specialized dataset.

I begin by arguing that we should treat the content of a literary work as, in part, a set of data-points in a cognitive input-space. Why should this be the case? The kind of pattern-recognition practices typical of literary or aesthetic reading, I propose, consistently call on the reader to discretize the work’s content into intercomparable data-points in order to appreciate the play of difference, repetition, and variation that makes up a literary work’s narrative and rhetorical progression: to appreciate a literary work aesthetically is, in part, to compare and contrast the various situations, objects, actions, places, characters, tropes, concepts, and images that vary over the work’s narrative and rhetorical course. The concrete imaginative content of a literary work is therefore, in part, a pattern-rich sequence of data-points in the reader’s representation space. On the analysis that I propose, the reader’s representation space acts as the input-space in an unsupervised representation-learning process that the reader carries out by studying the work’s concrete imaginative content. For the purposes of the current thesis, we put sequencing aside* and focus on the set of intercomparable data-points associated with a given literary work.
