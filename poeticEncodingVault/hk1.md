## A Defense of Poetry
#### Cognitive Systems

Craft minds, sealed within
Worldviews sketched by complex art,
Literature breathes.

#### Compression Schemas

Trained minds share the code,
From thought-nets vast and obscure,
Beyond raw ideas.

#### Romantic, Symbolist, and Modernist Meaning

In words, worlds unfold,
Bridging minds through crafted forms,
Beauty’s touch revealed.

#### Apology in Literature

Faith in art persists,
Rhythms show otherworld truths,
Thought and sense aligned.

#### Modernist Aesthetic Theory and Practice

Complex meanings dance,
Forms abstract, frail, and profound,
In Modernist minds.

#### Evaluating Modernist Dominance

Tightly wound concepts,
Fragmented narratives spin,
New meanings spring clear.

#### Ambient Meaning in Modernist Literature

Great texts weave a map,
Contexts breathe within each work,
Systems unmask truth.

#### Cognitive Mapping and Marxian Thought

Jameson named the quest,
Seeking maps of thought and life,
Literature’s grip firm.

#### The Argument for Constructivist Literature

Fragments tell full tales,
Epistemic engine churns,
Knowledge blooms from art.

#### Modernist Map-Making: A Cognitive Process

Not mere symbols here,
Systems rise in fragmented lines,
Sense in chaos found.

#### Theory of Uninterpretable Yet Constructive Texts

Shapes of thought reveal,
Beyond mere words, truths on edge,
Proven by the text.

#### Ending Notes on Radically Aesthetic Reading

Proofs beyond belief,
Sense in silent structures rise,
In a text’s deep heart.
