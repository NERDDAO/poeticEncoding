Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination
between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in
the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a
next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way,
subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other,
leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently
systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It
produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without
need for any planning, control, or even direct communication
between the agents. â€“ Wikipedia

Certain ideas are powerful enough to create a
butterfly effect, a swarm that will not be stopped by any
restraining force. The civil rights movement in the United
States was one such idea which no amount of opposition
could prevent. The power of stigmergy was proven in that
and many other points in history. Stigmergy is the action
based twin of an idea based system. If there are no official
authorities, anyone can act to further an idea and it is up to
the society or user group to accept or reject the act.

A personality based system can never allow for
mass collaboration on a global scale without representation
such as that seen in organizations like the United Nations.
If the world is to move away from representation and
allow all voices to be heard, we need to find methods of
collaboration which work with idea and action based
systems. Concentric user groups with epistemic
communities and knowledge bridges may work for idea
based systems. For action, stigmergy seems the best
option.

Currently, the typical response to a situation which
requires an action is to create a noun, in the form of acommittee, commission, organization, corporation, NGO,
government body, etc. Far too often, the action never
appears at all as the focus is always on the organization
and the personalities involved instead.

Most systems are now run by competitive
organizations. Competition creates redundancy, is slow
and wastes resources on idea protection, advertisement,
and more. Competition also requires secrecy which blocks
progress and auditing and causes lost opportunities and
ideas. Patents and copyrights further limit speed and the
potential for mass input of ideas. Collaboration between
the people with the greatest expertise does not happen
unless they are hired by the same project.

The alternative to competition has traditionally
been cooperation. This is most effective only in groups of
two to eight people. For groups larger than 25, cooperation
is agonizingly slow, an exercise in personality management
which quickly degenerates into endless discussion and
soothing of ruffled feathers, is extremely vulnerable to
agent provocateurs, and in large scale groups very seldom
accomplishes anything of value. Cooperation traditionally
operates on the democratic principle that all voices are
equal, so it does not allow for leaders, or users with greater
expertise, energy or understanding to have greater
influence than those on the periphery. Cooperation wastes
a great deal of time and resources in both discussing and
discussing the discussions. In an action based system, this
discussion is rarely required as the opinion of those not
doing the work is probably of little value unless it is
solicited advice from a trusted knowledgeable party.
